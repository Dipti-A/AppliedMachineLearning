"""This file shows a couple of implementations of the perceptron learning
algorithm. It is based on the code from Lecture 3, but using the slightly
more compact perceptron formulation that we saw in Lecture 6.

There are two versions: Perceptron, which uses normal NumPy vectors and
matrices, and SparsePerceptron, which uses sparse vectors and matrices.
The latter may be faster when we have high-dimensional feature representations
with a lot of zeros, such as when we are using a "bag of words" representation
of documents.
