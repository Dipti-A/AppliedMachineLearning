0/0	14 obvious crucial questions about the Covid vaccines ‚ÄúThey‚Äù originally promised the only way back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù was a vaccine for coronavirus. ‚ÄúThey‚Äù obviously lied. Fri Jan 29, 2021 - 8:26 pm EST January 29, 2021 (LifeSiteNews) - According to the government... If I get vaccinated: 1.- Can I stop wearing the mask? Government Response - No 2.- Can they reopen restaurants, pubs, bars etc and everyone work normally? Government Response - No 3.- Will I be resistant to covid? Government Response - Maybe, but we don't know exactly, it probably won't stop you getting it 4.- At least I won't be contagious to others anymore? Government Response - No you can still pass it on, possibly, nobody knows. 5.- If we vaccinate all children, will school resume normally? Government Response - No 6.- If I am vaccinated, can I stop social distancing? Government Response - No 7.- If I am vaccinated, can I stop disinfecting my hands? Government Response - No 8.- If I vaccinate myself and my grandfather, can we hug each other? Government Response - No 9.- Will cinemas, theatres and stadiums be reopened thanks to vaccines? Government Response - No 10.- Will the vaccinated be able to gather? Government Response - No 11.- What is the real benefit of vaccination? Government Response - The virus won't kill you. 12.- Are you sure it won't kill me? Government Response - No 13.- If statistically the virus won't kill me anyway ... Why would I get vaccinated?" Government Response - To protect others. 14.- So if I get vaccinated, the others are 100% sure I'm not infecting them? Government Response - No So to summarize, the Covid19 vaccine... Does not give immunity. Does not eliminate the virus. Does not prevent death. Does not guarantee you won‚Äôt get it. Does not prevent you from getting it. Does not stop you passing it on Does not eliminate the need for travel bans. Does not eliminate the need for business closures. Does not eliminate the need for lockdowns. Does not eliminate the need for masking. So...what is it actually doing? You haven‚Äôt forgotten that ‚Äúthey‚Äù originally promised the only way back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù was a vaccine for coronavirus. ‚ÄúThey‚Äù obviously lied. In addition, a number of prominent leaders have lately been insisting there will be no return to normal. They are now very open about saying that everything has permanently changed to a ‚Äúnew normal.‚Äù Klaus Schwab ‚Äì founder of the World Economic Forum ‚Äì makes it very clear in this excerpt from a talk by him. Everything that we are going through right now, including very dangerous, catastrophic lockdowns, will remain with us forever. Dr. Simone Gold talk below) that are not allowed to be used, is their excuse for this dramatic, imposed change on the entire world population for a virus and for the large majority of the population. Their supposed solution of the ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù covid vaccine, as you can see from the above list, is not really a medical solution at all. It is not only not effective, it is increasingly looking to be unusually dangerous for an alleged ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù, which it is not. Dr. Gold has recently given one of the best talks to date on the virus and dangers of the ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù vaccines. Everyone should watch this talk. It should be promoted around the world. So, again, what is the real purpose of these vaccines? They have already told us ‚Äì control of everyone to impose a New World Order/4th Industrial Revolution. We will all be required to have a vaccine passport or digital proof of vaccine, just as in Communist China, in order to enjoy already God-given rights and freedoms. Democracy and national sovereignty will be taken away and replaced by rule by a small, very powerful and wealthy elite. Everyone needs to stop watching all television and newspaper news and actively organize to oppose this world tyranny. Anyone who believes any of their propaganda and goes along with it is making the biggest mistake of their lives.

0/0	A vaccine isn‚Äôt going to bring back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù viruses change all the time, you will need many shots like the flu shot. No thanks, I don‚Äôt need nor do I want this experimental shot
1/1	A vaccine protects an individual‚Ä¶Community vaccination protects the whole community even those who can't vaccinate
0/0	A vaccine that contains nanotechnology is something I will take my chances without
0/0	A vaccine that was developed in 6-9 months?... Nope
0/0/0/0/0/0	A vaccine that was made in a year is sus i don't trust it
1/1	A vaccine which reduces "a nasty virus which can cause death or serious illness" to "a nasty virus which leaves you bedbound for a few days" is still a pretty good vaccine i don't see why doomers are so keen to pretend otherwise
1/1	A vaccine would be better for the economy of affected countries.
0/0	A vaccine? No thanks.
1/1	A very excellent vaccine that has no shady ingredients and no shady manufacturing mechanic
0/0	A whole lot of us will not take these vaccines and should not be forced to take them or our children! This is our right!
0/0	ABSOLUTELY NOT.They are skipping steps necessary for safe vaccine trials. They are trying to rush this because of the hysteria the media has created.
0/0	ABSOLUTELY NOT.They are skipping steps necessary for safe vaccine trials. They are trying to rush this because of the hysteria the media has created. They will have no idea how effective it is, or if it can cause life-threatening side effects down the road.
1/1	ALL need to take it in order to save lives!!!!
1/1	ALL the vaccines are highly effective and safe. Take it when you are offered.
0/0	ANTIVAXX FOR LIFE
1/1	ARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 is not a myth. It is a life-threatening disease that might affect to your underlying conditions. Better to study the true science of coronaviruses and listen to the experts how the #mRNA vaccines will save more lives than never.
0/-1	Abortion: Ofc its your choice Vaccine: Take this untested vaccine, or else
1/1	About time something was done about this pandemic
1/1/-1	About time. I can‚Äôt wait for this nightmare to be over.
1/1	Absolutely - Yes 100%! I will be taking the vaccine the very moment that my turn comes!
0/1	Absolutely getting it. My dad, friend, and niece got Moderna vaccine. Only side effect was 1 had a little soreness in arm. My healthy 43 yo cousin got Covid, it caused a blood clot in her leg, and they had to amputate.
1/1	Absolutely getting the vaccine. Here's why: I understand how it works, I know it doesn't contain ANY virus & therefore can't infect me, it won't change my DNA, & they're not implanting an RFID chip. Pfizer & Moderna were tested on 74K ppl, & millions more have been vaxxed safely.

0/0	Absolutely not. Although SARS-CoV-2 appears to be a slightly nastier virus than usual, it‚Äôs not anything to panic about. The world has gone absolutely nuts about this, but if you study the science, dig into the situation, you‚Äôll realize that what we have is panic and not a dangerous virus that calls for extreme measures. The ‚Äúcure‚Äù has been far, far, far worse than the disease.
0/0	Absolutely not. I don‚Äôt get flu shots, pneumonia vaccines, or anything else, either. I never get the flu, but everyone I know who gets a flu shot ends up with the flu. And I have a couple of autoimmune diseases and have no idea what havoc the vaccine might cause in my body. Besides, I‚Äôve had COVID already and it wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal.
0/0	Absolutely not. Not a wise decision. People need to wise up and do their due diligence. Turn off the programming and ask themselves some questions. Like: why would anyone trust ANY of those people in ANY situation? They absolutely do NOT have our best interest at heart. They want to bring the population down to less than 5% of what it is now and THEY'VE TOLD US SO. WAKE UP! .

They want to bring the population down to less than 5% of what it is now and THEY'VE TOLD US SO. WAKE UP! üëä.
0/0	Absolutely not. Not unless they force me too. I will not take a vaccine with an MRNA component on moral grounds. I am allergic to some of the components. I react to even a flu vaccine.
1/-1	Absolutely yes. If there were substantial negative side effects we‚Äôd have seen them by now. That‚Äôs what such extensive trials are for.
1/1	Absolutely!! Thank you for looking out for healthcare professionals, CDC! Pharmacists have been excitedly getting vaccinated!
1/1	Absolutely, yes!Vaccines are probably the single greatest advance in preventative medicine ever made by the human race. Furthermore, they are getting safer and safer. Vaccines that don‚Äôt even contain a whole pathogen, dead or alive, are an awesome advance.
1/1/1	Absolutely. As soon as I can.The vaccine manufacturers have exercised great caution and subjected the vaccines to intense third party unbiased testing and review. The test data are extremely impressive and the good the vaccines will bring is far beyond the risks.
1/-1	Absolutely. Easy choice.
1/1	Absolutely. I don't want to contract Covid, nor do I want to be spreading it around. I will take the vaccine gladly, as often as needed.
1/1	Absolutely.I am male and I am in my 60‚Äôs. I am in one of the highest risk groups in the population
1/-1	Absolutely.I am male and I am in my 60‚Äôs. I am in one of the highest risk groups in the population.
1/1	Absolutely~!! The vaccine development was moving faster than normal because the scientific community made it their top priority all over the world! Thank you for protecting American lives, CDC!
1/1	According to health experts, there could be regular side effects expected after a vaccination, such as muscle aches. But similar to other types of vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines undergo trials and testing involving thousands of volunteers...
0/0	According to history vaccines don't work. When I came to this country I had to be vaccinated did it work? no, not even the flu shot works just to make money. One day judgement day will come when God judges all these greedy politicians.
1/1	According to the CDC's 2017 report, 91.5% of children aged 19-35 months were vaccinated against MMR, 92.7% against polio. Vaccination acceptance is way more universal than the internet's portrayal of vaccination rates
1/1	According to the WHO, "there is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection."
0/0	Active immunity AKA natural immunity is way safer than vaccines because there are no potential side effects having the sickness but then you conquer it and you never get again
0/0	Actually, mrna has NEVER been used on humans, a quick Google search will show you that. And yes, I know its been used in trials BUT never actually used on humans.
1/1	Actually, the vaccine does help stop you from becoming seriously ill with the virus, and substantially reduces your likelihood of infecting others.
0/0	Actually,¬†COVID-19 caused less mortality than the flu up until around the 15-24 age range last year. Measles has been identified to have an IFR of around¬†.5% in children, whereas COVID is estimated around¬†0.003% for 0-19.
0/0	Add another measure to the chart... deaths from corona vaccine...anyone who dies 28 days of having a vaccine..
1/1	Add to the number of people in the community who are protected from getting¬†COVID-19¬†‚Äî making it harder for the disease to spread and contributing to herd immunity
1/1	Additionally mRNA vaccines have been USED in cancer therapy successfully.
1/1	Admittedly my plan was to wait on a vaccine so I could get the good one rather than the first one however with the 1st seemly to have a 90% effectiness perhaps the 1st is the correct choice. I have two risk factors and my county has a 15% positivity rate so might be of the essence.
0/0	Advance R.I.P. to those who will take covid vaccines.
0/0	Advance rip for takng vaccine
0/0	Afraid of vaccinations? No, i am afraid of vaccine that is not even a year old
0/0/0/0/0	Afraid of vaccines? No, I‚Äôm afraid of a vaccine that they complete in less than 6 months. Gee, what could go wrong?
0/0	After a few years, who knows what may happen!
1/1	After a frustrating few weeks of signing up for lists and having computer glitches, my parents in Michigan just got their first doses of the vaccine. I'm so happy I could scream.
1/1	After all this time we are still in the fight , hopefully we'll be able to put this "COVID-19 behind us ..
1/1	After having covid I'll definitely have the vaccine. I wouldn't wanna go through that again
1/-1	After my first dose (see previous post for details), I thought maybe I got the side-effects ‚Äúout of the way‚Äù.
0/0	After one day the safe vaccine caused an issue, not known or tested for............
1/-1	After reading some of these comments I would urge vaccine makers to develop one that has a high level of stopping people being idiots
1/1	After receiving two shots, I can visit my friends
1/1	After seeing the information and doing my research I am excited for this type of vaccine it opens the door on so many possibilities.
1	After taking some Advil, went a lifted some weights at home the same day with no issues
1/1	After the vaccine is injected, your body uses instructions in the DNA/RNA to make copies of this virus part (or antigen). Your body recognises these and mounts an immune response, ready to protect you the next time you encounter the virus.
1/-1	After we're vaccinated, must we still wear a mask to protect those who have not been vaccinated?
1/1	After you get the first vaccination, your body is reving up the immune system and ready to fight COVID if it comes.
1/0	Agreed. Too bad we got putin's puppy as president, which i'm sure he will try to make money off the vaccine for himself.
1/1	Ah well, Let those of us who want it, get it and let us empathise with the families of the rest as we read about their funerals .
0/0	Ah yeah.. JnJ, the company giving u cancer with the baby powder...lol.. y'all hurry up and get those vaccines!
1/0	Ah yes, the Karen‚Äôs have come together to make the ultimate cringe
0/1	Ah yes. These televised vaccines has really convinced me to inject it into my own body. Thank you for posting!
1/1	Ahh inject it into my veins as quickly as possible! It is a well known fact that most anti vaxxers are actually just scared of needlesüòÇthey‚Äôre babies

0/0	All animal studies done with this type of treatment Die'd when introduced to the virus ! This vaccine is step one to population control !
1/1	All evidence is still pointing to the fact that the AZ vaccine will stop the majority of people getting seriously ill! I will be having it when offered!
0	All garbage vaccines, and they're not even vaccines by definition.
1/1	All good News showing slowly we are going in the right direction ,I personally waiting for the one from Oxford University then i feel we are turning the corner .
0/0/0/0	All is a big lie!!!!! Good luck if you survive a few years after getting vaccinated.
1/1	All my coworkers reacted to their shot within 24 hours, so when I had no reaction during that time, I thought I was in the clear. But, nope. 36 hours later, I was in bed alternating between chills and feeling like I was burning up. 48 hours post vaccine, all better! Worth it.
1/1	All my grandparents have been now vaccinated against Covid in Chile! Super happy and hoping that everyone will receive a vaccine in time!!!
1/1	All my mum (84) talked about for the past year was finding a vaccine for Covid. Today, though she‚Äôs in recovery after surgery, she smiled when I told her we‚Äôve started vaccinations.
0/-1	All of these things, and more, have been mentioned in claims that we‚Äôve seen on the internet, or heard about from people who contacted us.
0/-1	All sheepeople line up first
0/0	All that take their corno vaccine will I am sure have delayed sickness perhaps death untraceable to the vaccine they will have deniability
0/0	All the Pzifer deaths are just ignored and not reported in MSM.
1/-1	All the credit go to scientists...not the golf and tweeter king.
1/-1	All the dislikes are ignorant people.
1/1	All the evidences points in favor of vaccination, just use your brain
1	All the feels for this! I was surprised that I got choked up seeing help on the way, this year has worn me down in ways I don‚Äôt even recognize yet. THANK YOU Pfizer-BioNTech, UPS, and FedEx for getting the vaccine distributed. Makes me proud to see it ship out of GR!
0/0	All the negative commenters, you're commenting on a short trailer, watch the whole movie. There is more than enough proof. I grew up in Africa, we only got polio and German measles vaccinations. Most of us got measles, mumps, chicken pox, glandular fever etc We were away from school for a week, I never heard of any child dying. Now it's a vaccination for everything, even for the flu!!! It's a money making racket.
1/1	All the results we have seen are mostly positive with Covid vaccine... fine if you cannot have it because of underlying health probs... but if not... everyone should comply
1/1	All the work that rich countries are doing now to develop vaccines will save lives in developing countries too. Without a vaccine, those countries are at even greater risk than wealthy ones, because it‚Äôs even harder for them to do physical distancing and shutdowns.
0/0	All these medical conditions (except for the genetic mutations) can be mediated with gluten free casein free diet. Organic food. Filtered water/air. Nothing to do with vaccines.
0/0	All this bs and you still think this poison is safe???? Ya'll need to stop smoking whatever you're smoking.
1/0	All those infected experienced only a mild form of the disease, and NONE were hospitalized. So, get the covid vaccine. It may save your life.
0/0	All those vaccines made you autistic, as expected
0/0	All vaccines adverse reactions listed directly on the package insert is : DEATH
0/0	All you people who say you won't take it need to stick with it. I don't want to be one of the last hold outs when they start blocking people from entering stores without proof of vaccination. Or if my job makes it mandatory. It has to be all of us.
0/0	Allah will save me, don‚Äôt need no needles
0/0	Allergic reaction. How about just Fucking Poison
0/0	Allergic reaction? Ya mean side affects
0/0	Allergic reactions and face paralysis are some of the side effects so far. You would have to be out of your mind to take the vaccine.
1/1	Almost convinced me that perhaps COVID-19 could be used to get rid of some of the stupid ones! This is a pandemic boys and girls. It can kill a lot of people. The rules are intended to keep,you safe from it.
1/0	Almost every complication shows up within two weeks. So far, the mild side effects are the ones you want
1/1	Already got my flu vaccine and I can't wait to get the COVID vaccine
0/0	Already had and recovered from covid. I wont be taking any vaccine anytime soon. I'm going to need to see alot more long term effects results
1/0	Alrhough I don't understand everything, at least I understand something! Ty, Jesus bless you Medcram
1/1	Also I‚Äôm getting the second covid vaccine today
1/1	Also if doctors were al a part of some conspiracy why would they all be getting it?
0/0	Also just want to say the side effects of this vaccine sound worse than covid-19 itself.
1/0	Also just want to say the side effects of this vaccine sound worse than covid-19 itself. You do realize it's still not as bad as the flu right?
1/1	Also mind blowing when ppl say they won't get the vaccine because they don't know the long term effects (which i agree to an extent) , but yet don't give a shit about the long term effects covid has. I rather get the vaccine than get covid.
0/0	Also the amish never take vaccines and therefore you will never find an autistic amish.
1/1	Also this morning, I've had my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine.
0/0	Also, I researched the vaccines attempts for sars and mers. Yes, there will be some post injection adverse reactions but it was the long term immune system issues that were the problem. Have not found anything yet that says they overcame those issues. So, the long term consequences are not known by the public but pretty sure the vaccine pushers know.
0/0	Altering instructions with mRNA to respond to a virus is genetic manipulation and changes the DNA blueprint that you are born with.....no thanks, i'll stay me.
1/1	Although the vaccine is rushed that doesnt mean it isnt safe for use. they aren't just skipping past the "testing phase", they are still taking many precautions to make sure its effects do more good than harm.
1/1	Always get my flu and other vaccines. Will get the covid vaccine as soon as it is available to seniors in Orlando
0/0	Always staying safe...too afraid to have it
0/-1	Am A Little Bit Confused?!?
0/0	Am not getting vaccine. Am healthy and drink more alcohol than water I'll be fine
1/1	Am seeing cases now of vaccinated patients not catching covid at all when exposed at home - or much milder illness, Dramatic local outbreak in local care home where those vaccinated were spared.This is 1st hand / coal face experience
0/0	Am very sceptical about this deadly vaccine.
1/1	Amazing information in such dark times!! Got mine two weeks ago no side effects
1/1	Amazing news, get every one injected ASAP, let's get on top of this virus and get back to some kind of normality.
1/1	Amazing they have a vaccine already !
0/1	Amazing vaccine
1/-1	Amazing video bro, taught me so much and presented in a nice logical order with visuals. This is what they need to keep replaying on mainstream media for the rest of the idiiots.
1/1	Amazing what humans can do when we come together and throw a bunch of money at a common goal. This is why science funding is necessary.
0/0	Amazing, isn‚Äôt it? In order to avoid an illness with few or mild symptoms, you get a severe reaction, instead, to a vaccine which doesn‚Äôt actually protect you from the illness with few or mild symptoms that you‚Äôre trying to avoid.
1/1	Amen. The risks of not getting vaccinated outweigh the risks of COVID. Period.
0/-1/-1	America wouldn‚Äôt need a vaccine so quickly if people grew up and did what they were supposed to do during the pandemic
1/0	America wouldn‚Äôt need a vaccine so quickly if people grew up and did what they were supposed to do during the pandemic...
0/0	Americans don't trust the msm for regular information. How can we trust them with our lives??
0/1	Americans have some serious trust issues! Doubting the medical field and the doctors. They think they know better than any expert.
0/0	Americans should also have the freedom to decline the vaccine
1/0	Americans: Show us the government officials taking the vaccine and we will see if they mutate into zombies or not. Americans when government officials take the vaccine on live national television: Look at how they blocked the view, its obviously water!
1/-1	Americas Frontline Doctors is the only place you should get your news regarding this nonsense
0/0	An NHS nurse who has contracted Covid-19 three weeks after being vaccinated says she is "angry and heartbroken"
1/1	An anti vaxer getting autism would be an improvement.
0/0	An autoimmune reaction to the vaccine, and you wonder why more and more people are sick with autoimmune diseases.
1/1	An effective vaccine will protect a person who receives it by lowering their chances of getting COVID-19 if they encounter the coronavirus.
0/0	An untested shot that wont keep you from getting the virus or keep you from spreading it?... so what is it?
1/-1	And I am NOT the only one reporting these side effects! It‚Äôs an immune response.
0/0	And I am still not taking it
1/1	And Im sitting here in good old Germany where they fucked everything up and people are going to be waiting month to get a vaccine. I did some research on a site and it suggested that if we continue to vaccine people this fast, then I'll be able to get one in November 2023. smfh.
0/0	And can you say how many people has this vaccinacion has killed...and it has...no thank you i will not be injected‚Ä¶
1/1	And enough. Am getting the jab now.
0/0	And getting that vaccine after living that long was the stupidest thing she could have ever done!
0/0	And hardly a word on taking care of yourself through a healthy lifestyle and not compromising your immune system. Its easier to believe that taking a vaccine that has never been used on humans and produced in the shortest time ever. So many questions answered with trust us. A vaccine that experts cannot tell us the duration of effectiveness, whether or not it will prevent you from transmitting, whether or not it will protect you from the mutations and of course long term adverse effects. I am not criticizing those that take it and will not tolerate criticism for not taking it.
1/0	And how haven't we managed to get a 90 odd percent positive result with things like malaria etc? Is it because they don't affect us western whites as much? Seems weird that they have managed to create a vaccine that is so affective in such a short space of time to me??
0/0	And if you have any allergies that you don‚Äôt know about don‚Äôt come !!!!!!
0/0	And it isn't just these v4ccines! Those long-term health issues are caused by most vaccines in some people. People with the wrong genetics, I suppose. I'm actually all for depopulation by sterilization. The poor and stupid human is a serious issue and there are too many of us. However, these long-term health issues are what I have a problem with. Another thing is that they're passed on through our descendants. NOT GOOD FOR HUMAN EVOLUTION.
0/0	And nobody should force me or anyone to take it
0/0	And not to mention all the big companies rolling out these untested vaccines like Pfizer have been sued to death and paid up huge fines for illegal marketing, improper labeling of medications, foreign corrupt practices, bribery, government contract related offenses and drug/medical equipment safety violations. But you can trust them.
1/1	And now there are three! This news just keeps getting better and better!
0/0	And now who is lining up to play guinea pigs
1/-1	And people complain about us Americans being uneducated, stubborn halfwits. The absolute gaul
0/0	And people die almost immediately, get very sick for weeks, oh and they do it on tv. For somthing no worse then the flu
1/1	And stay home. And get the vaccine.
1/0	And the fear propaganda gets more deceptive and brazen. We still refuse to comply.
0/0	And the masses will receive this via mandated covid-19 vaccine.. good luck mandating me to take that...
1	And the vaccine is the only thing today that can stop the pandemic
0/0	And they say it were not lab created.....hm....I think it was! They are actually telling you how they created it without you understanding that they did create the virus!
0/0	And vaccines affect female fertility. Goes hand in hand.
1/1	And vaccines save lives !
0/0	And we are supposed to believe all this crap?
1/1	And we did nearly 600000 on Sunday probably more than the whole of the EU
0/0	And what are you going to do about the deaths its causing; i.e. Dr. in Florida died after getting the vaccine or the face paralysis or the other side effects that is happening?
0/0	And what is stopping your immune system attacking itself when it realizes there is a foreign entity in its cells?.
0/0	And what other info these mRna include ??!!!
1/0	And within these populations they will pass Covid back and forth and takes us to ever more mutated viruses. The government will have to take serious steps both coercive and rewarding in the name of public health to encourage vaccination.
1/1	And yet my mother is still convinced the vaccines are actively killing otherwise completely healthy people. I can‚Äôt fucking wait to get vaccinated and rub it in her face
0/0	And yet people are dying who have taken the vaccines
0/0	And you didn't even mention potential long term damage to human cells get lost with your experiment
0/0	And you won't see this article on any other news site, that's for sure. I'm sure there is already in place a media black out reporting severe side effects or death from the vaccine. The problem is, you don't how it will effect you till it's too late. I'll take my chances with the virus.
0/0	Angelo Me too I'm not having this poison in my body just to be a rat on a wheel
0/0	Another "vaccine" to refuse
0/0	Another brainwashing... That gives me more warning NOT to have it
1/1	Another great result on COVID vaccine! AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine resulted in 67% reduction in positive swabs (i.e., infection) among those vaccinated. Vaccine will reduce transmission. Data also support 12 week prime-boost dosing interval.
1/1	Another massively important finding is that in this huge trial, not a single person was hospitalized with Covid >22 days after single dose vaccination. Not one. That changes everything. Well done to scientists & government for choosing the strategy in the face of fierce criticism
1/1	Another non-headline to grab attention .. a 'small study' ... why can't the media wait until the real people .. the scientists and the doctors ... have carried out extensive research to find out the exact facts. That of course wouldn't make a 'worrying, headline.
0/1	Another person died yesterday after the second dose...... #NoVaccineForMe
0/0	Another person dies after taking the Coronavirus vaccine. #NoVaccine4me
1/-1	Another reason for the vaccine is not to spread the virus.
1/1	Another reason to be mad at antivaxxers is because they can spread disease. Some people don‚Äôt have health insurance or could afford certain vaccines, meanwhile these people who do have health insurance and are privileged enough to afford it choose not to.
1	Another video where people are completely skipping over the convulsions. Still, the vaccine is statistically worth taking for those over 65.
1/1	Another well informed broadcast that helps to keep moral high and provides good understanding to us lay-people, thank you for your perseverance.
0/0	Answer "NO" why? because the polio epedemic happened after everyone was vacinated and 80,000,000 died

1/1	Anti vaxxers are misinforming ignorant people. I trust science and would definitely get the vaccine.
1/1	Anti vaxxers aren't operating on empirical evidence or logic.
1/1	Anti vaxxers do not grasp the fact that risk for disease increases exponentially when more and more people forgo vaccines. They are entitled and selfish
1/1	Anti vaxxers should be put on a list and denied medical help when they contract COVID ! Simple
1/1/1	Anti vaxxers: "There is no proof of the virus" People and medical workers who've died from the virus:ok I guess
1/1	Anti-Vaxers: The black plague stopped naturally without any help of any vaccines 1/3 of Europe: Am I a joke to you?
1/1	Anti-Vaxxers are crazy. Serious side effects from vaccines are rare. Even vaccines that effects you higher than the average will be protecting a person from that disease.
1/1	Anti-Vaxxers with no qualifications in virology: * Nervous Sweating *
1/0	Anti-Vaxxers: VAXEN IZ poISIN AaAAaA fUck vaCcin SHIT! Me, a smort boi: shut

1/1	Anti-vaxers are heroes. Single handily saving endangered deadly diseases from going extinct.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers are an existential threat to humanity. End of discussion.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers are nothing else but idiots IMHO.
0/1	Anti-vaxxers harass people waiting on line to get the vaccine at Dodger Stadium
1/1/1/1	Anti-vaxxers literally make me cry. Because they could kill me.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers make me so irrationally angry, because they‚Äôre the type of people who just... reject science.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers make me so irrationally angry, because they‚Äôre the type of people who just... reject science. We can have differing opinions all day long, but only when they‚Äôre legitimate opinions based in a world of facts. You can‚Äôt just deny science. It‚Äôs fucking science.
1/-1	Anti-vaxxers should be denied health care when they get sick.
1/1	Anti-vaxxing is all about taking unsubstantiated misinformation as fact
0/0	Antibody dependent enhancement ADE was caused by the SARS Cov 1 vaccine years ago during testing and it was never approved. This also happened with the Dengue vaccine. as it does with many RNA viruses. There were no long term safety trials to determine if this will happen with this vaccine. so count me out. I'm not taking this vaccine and becoming a part of the largest vaccine trial in history.
0/0	Antigenic shift (mutation) is a common normal biological function among coronavirus /more so with flu. This is precisely why vaccines have little to no chance of effectiveness for Corona type viruses. History has proven this true over and over. Corna vaccines are notoriously problematic ( mostly due to rapid weakening) and have never been successful.
0/0	Antivax for life
1/1	Antivax nonsense. No safety steps are being skipped over. Different trial stages are being run concurrently, rather than after the previous stage. They're being performed in different populations concurrently across the globe, rather than after eachother. Your skepticism is simply ignorance.
1/1	Antivaxers and antimaskers should be put on a desert island so sane people can work on achieving herd immunity
1/1	Antivaxers are idiots
1/-1	Antivaxxer complained that all the cats at my local shelter are vaccinated. There are diseases which are untreatable in cat‚Äôs which can be vaccinated against
0/0	Antivaxxers and BTS fans give me life in certain comments √∞≈∏Àú‚Äö√∞≈∏Àú‚Äö√∞≈∏¬§¬£
1/1	Antivaxxers are a dumb breed of people
1/1	Antivaxxers are those people who would flip out if you told them that all water contains dihydrogen monoxide and that 100% of people who consume it ultimately die!
1/1	Antivaxxers think the syringe and needle is for a horse but they're so tiny it fits in a babies hand.
1/0	Antivaxxers will be the death of themselves
1/1	Antt-vaxxers should be arrested and their children taken from them.
0/0	Any Person with a well nurished Immunsystem doesn't need this vaccine. I hope it will not made mandatory for everyone.
0/0	Any chance the cell-manufactured spike protein, on exiting the cell membrane, could then instead turn around and plug into the very same cell receptors on the outside of the cell membrane that the whole virus would normally use? Where I'm going with this, is if the answer is 'yes', then what would happen if a cell was then swamped with spikes stuck on it's outside - i.e: would it then look like 'non-self' to our immune system, and come under attack(!), effectively causing some kind of auto-immune disease ? . . . also, you didn't address the allergic deleterious issue with the novel lipid nanoparticle, causing issues in some people . . .
1/1	Any coronavirus vaccine that is approved must go through all the clinical trials and safety checks all other licensed medicines go through. The MHRA follows international standards of safety.
1/1	Any country that¬†doesnt¬†provide a vaccine to all their people for free is hurting themselves by doing so. Glad to see Canada has the right idea!
0/0	Any long term effects on this vaccine? I won't be taking it.
0/0	Any long term safely studies? I'll give it a miss then
1/1	Any progress toward prioritizing Indiana teachers for COVID vaccination?
1/1/1	Any side effect is a reasonable pay off for the opportunity to protect ourselves from this virus.
0/-1	Any test results data to proof what they say? Or should we blindly beleive all what pharma say?
1/1	Any vaccine that passed its trial is better than no vaccine. And one shot is better than no shot. Just focus on vaccinating as many people as possible as fast as possible.
0/1	Anybody think about getting an antibody test before considering getting the vaccine??? I mean according to cc studies back in may of 2020 there was more than 10x the amount of ppl getting the virus who had already had it....I don't understand why our nation is so forgetful and spinning in this wheel over and over...
0/-1	Anyone have any better ideas. scary part is all the nurses and doctors get it first.
0/-1	Anyone here can have my share....Cheers
0/0	Anyone taking a vaccine for a disease that has a 99%+ recovery rate needs their head examined
0/0	Anyone taking any vaccine created in less than a year, not tested on animals, not tested for future birth defects, must be crazy.
1/1	Anyone who does not want to be vaccinated is fine. But then do the world a favor and stay home forever, thank you.
0/0	Anyone who wants it ..they can have my dose! I'm not taking it... I don't feel the need to take a vaccine for a virus that has a 99.9 % survival rate
0/0	Anything phony Dr. Fauci recommends, I'd do the exact opposite.
0/-1	Anytime a doctor says "There is no long term data" then you are taking a huge risk. They didn't even test this vaccine on lab rats.
0/0	Apparently some people think that getting a vaccine thats not 100 percent effective is a good idea.....
0/-1	Apparently the side effects are horrendous.
1/1	Applied to graduate, certified my rank list, and got my second #CovidVaccine today so I guess you could say I was productive!!!!!
1/1	Appreciated very helpful
1/1	Aprove this already! I'm in this trial and 99.99% positive I got the placebo, but I'm slated to get the real deal once this goes green.
1/1	Are flu shots free for everyone or just select groups? I agree though, vaccination for most things should be a free public provided service
0/0	Are people allowed to question what is injected into them or is that going to be a criminal offence?
1/1	Are people happy to just sit home for the rest of their lifes?
0/0	Are theses paid actors or models posing for this... to make us think they got the vaccine
0/-1	Are they 100% Alzheimer and cancer free?
0/0	Are they forcing us to use covid vaccine? I will not
1/1	Are vaccines safe? #Vaccines are now safer than ever before as they go through rigorous testing and development, subject to strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness.
0/0	Are we ignoring the fact, these vaccines have aborted baby cells? I am really confused.
0/0	Are you SURE you want a covid vaccine? Because once you get it, there‚Äôs no taking it out of you and you will be permanently stuck with the adverse side effects
1/0	Are you going to get a vaccine for covid or are you still going to risk your life
0/-1	Are you guys going to make the rdif chip video too?
0/0	Are you nuts everyone takes the risks for everyone else and gets the vaccine? Everyone in my family who had Covid-19 didn't get sick with it. But we should take the risk and possibly get an adverse reaction to a vaccine. Anyone coming dictating to me or trying to stab me with a jab will be getting stabbed in the head.
0	Are you okay? NO! cause you will be dead after taking the vaccine!
1/1	Are you taking that COVID vaccine? Or are you waiting for your pastor to give you holy water? Covid 19 is real bruhh
1/1	Arrest any anti-vaxxers / anti-maskers who show up to try and disrupt this process.
0/-1	As I said in my book, we don't have a COVID-19 vaccine and may never. We have experimental biological agents using new mRNA technology that result in pathogenic priming & fertility issues and that do not stop transmission. Big Pharma immune from liability.
0/0	As a African my ancestors never needed man made medecine. Nature made herbs only I dont eat man made food, I'm vegan.
1/1	As a Brit our vaccination procurement and delivery is probably the single competent thing that the government has managed during the pandemic.
1/1	As a Type 1 diabetic who spends 40-plus hours a week at @Cronkite_ASU, I was thrilled to receive my 2nd dose of the COVID-19 vaccine early this morning. But I'm most grateful for the students I'm around every day who has been responsible, thoughtful and diligent to keep us safe.
0/0	As a black man in America, I'm gonna go ahead and opt out of the Tuskagee group and wait a bit before I commit to something like this.
1/1	As a funeral director, I just want to extend my thanks to the anti-vaxxers, you lot are really supporting the industry during these difficult times.
1/1	As a guy with autism, I am deeply offended. Bottom line is if you don‚Äôt vaccinate your kid they might die before their 5th birthday.
0/0	As a health care professional myself I will not get it.
1/1	As a healthcare worker, I'm incredibly excited that my wife (also healthcare) and I may get vaccinated in the next couple of months. That'll be such a load off, especially since she runs a Covid clinic at the moment.
1/-1	As a midwife I‚Äôm pro vaccine.. But have real concerns of this idea of compulsory vaccine and shaming individuals and communities.. Last I checked we lived in a free country.. Look what‚Äôs in front of you rather than inventing problems.. Bring people with you and do not alienate
0/0	As a passed middle aged adult with no underlying conditions, I will ALSO not get this shot!
1/1	As a person with autism, I find it incredibly curious some people would rather have a sick or dead child than an autistic one
1/1	As a retired nurse, I will gladly and gratefully get my vaccine when it‚Äôs my turn! It has been very heartwarming to know my former colleagues were getting their first dose this week and seeing the smiles in their eyes on their masked faces!
0/0	As a young adult with no underlying conditions. I will not get this shot.
0/0	As an Adult...thankfully I have never had to take a vaccine...Not going to start now...I trust my immune system.
0/0	As for me and my children. No thanks we will pass on an untested rushed vaccine with little to no information or liability. Nah fk that..
0/0/0	As for me and my household, we shall not take this V.
0/0	As for the genetic therapy misleadingly called a vaccination
1/1	As long as not from China
0/0	As long as the companies making the vaccines are shielded by a no liability clause, nobody should take the vaccine. ANY company should be held responsabile for the product or service it provides
1/1	As long as they're safe. They have to be safe while you rush through to get them out!
1	As someone in education I'd feel its irresponsible not to try my beat to keep the kids safe
1/1	As someone who wants myself and my family to take the vaccine, I welcome this news.
1/1	As soon as I can get this vaccine I will be rolling up my sleeve. A day or two of flu like symptoms is better than 3 weeks on a ventilator.
1/1	As soon as I can, I will be vaccinated. The only way to deal with this pandemic right now. Thank you for your engagement
1/1	As soon as I can, I will be vaccinated. The only way to deal with this pandemic right now. Thank you for your engagement.
1/1	As soon as I can. I can't afford to die/get severe complications from Covid-19. I am 51 and I need it! 2 friends have several severe complications from having it.
1/1	As soon as it‚Äôs available on the NHS, I will be happy to have it.
1/1	As soon as it‚Äôs opened up to cancer patients here in Alberta you can bet I will be getting this vaccine with no concerns!
1/1	As soon as people can‚Äôt get on a plane to Benidorm without a vaccine you‚Äôll see a dramatic increase in the uptake.
0/-1	As the "vaccine" is a bioweapon in disguise, they realize it would be a war crime to vaccinate the prisoners. That's why they aren't doing it.

1	As the vaccine becomes available many people might feel they should not get it. But as suggested in the article, by getting it you could take care of your family in the event someone in your house gets sick.
0/1	As they are the most vulnerable, and there's a shortage, they'll perhaps have enough of the Pfizer for them. If not, the German state will have a lower bill for the old-age pensions in a few months time.
0/0	As they increase the vaccine shots . The more cases of covid increases ! The people were told , wash hands , wear masks , lock downs , close business , 6feet social distancing and don't see family members because this can increase your risk of getting exposed ! Now let's inject you with a virus straight into your bloodstream ?!? This is now good for you ?!? The people getting vaccinated are becoming walking Petri dishes and helping to infect health people in the public .
1/1	As they should. And once the vaccine is widely available, they should require all passengers to show proof of vaccination or medical waiver.
1/1	As we distribute more vaccine, we‚Äôre getting closer to beating this pandemic.
1/1	As we face compounding crises, I am feeling very blessed to have received my 2nd #COVID19Vaccine dose today. I encourage everyone to roll up your sleeve when your time comes. #VaccinesWork
1/1	As you are a vital health care worker, I hope you have either already been vaccinated or gotten an appointment to get one in the next few days, SD.
0/0	Aside from the sophistry of wearing masks, I WILL NOT take any #COVID19 #vaccine. ZERO of the normally mandated Phase 4 (long-term side effect) studies done (usually 6-10 years). Using fear as a tool illustrates the disingenuous nature of those controlling the population.
1/-1	Ask 1000 people whether they would want to vaccinate. 500 says no The press: half of Britons don't want a vaccination
0/0	Ask me in a year what I think about this experiment vaccine? Because I‚Äôm not taking it.
1/1	Aspirin has side effects u all gonna stop taking that too?
0/-1	Associate Professor Mary-Ann Davies tells me that the most common #covishield vaccine side-effects are: 1. Pain in the area where the injection has been administered 2. Mild flu and a bit of nausea or dizziness
0/0	AstraZeneca is useless!!
1/-1	AstraZeneca says it aims to have a ‚Äònext generation‚Äô Covid vaccine ready for use in the autumn which will incorporate some of the mutated variants of concern. Work well underway to design new vaccine structure at Oxford.
1/1	AstraZeneca would be my choice for sure.
1/1	At last my Dad has been given the #vaccine so relieved
1/-1	At least 90% of the comments here look like they've been written by Neanderthals without an education.
1/1	At least three-quarters of residents in most U.S. skilled nursing facilities had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Keep up the great work.
1/1	At least we know there is a vaccine that works.
1/1	At least your body won't turn into a coronavirus duplication factory if you get successfully vaccinated.
1/1	At my hospital only 40% of our staff have been vaccinated. It‚Äôs so disheartening. We‚Äôve had the vaccine since December 18th. I signed up the very minute the appointments were available.
1/-1	At some point it has to be personal responsibility
0/0	At the highest levels of the medical cartel, vaccines are a top priority because they cause a weakening of the immune system. I know that may be hard to accept, but its true. The medical cartel, at the highest level, is not out to help people, it is out to harm them, to weaken them. To kill them. At one point in my career, I had a long conversation with a man who occupied a high government position in an African nation. He told me that he was well aware of this. He told me that WHO is a front for these depopulation interests
1/1	At the moment we have only vaccines. To find medicines needs more time. We have to return at our life, and to do it, all the world have to be vaccinated. At the moment is the only way to get out from the pandemic.
0/-1	At the same time, many people are ambivalent because, while they want to protect themselves against infection, they also fear possible side effects from vaccination.
1/1	At this point, the question has to be how many people are going to be co winners of a Nobel prize. Three viable vaccines this week, a year after sars-covid2 was even discovered. Phenomenal.
1/1	At this rate, everyone will be vaccinated by the end of 2021. Hopefully the rate continues to go up.
0/-1	At what month or year after taking a vaccine for Covid do you become sterile or your health deteriorates until death? And by then nobody will question or even think about you being sterile or have died because of the vaccine you took a few months or years ago. The pushers of the vaccines response? In public, "we didnt know" In private, "Mission accomplished"
1/-1	At work today, our company was notifying us that we have free flu shot vouchers that we can print and use at any pharmacy. This lady said ‚ÄúThe mRNA contains aborted fetus cells and i am a Christian I unfortunately can‚Äôt be pro life and pro vax at the same time.‚Äù A couple people agreed with her. Where did this aborted fetus cells shit come from?! I simply cannot understand how a person gets to the point where they believe something like that.
1/1	Augurs well. Soon all the states will be Covid free.
0/0	Autism was never heard of in the scientific community until they started administrating vaccines in the 30's.
1/1	Awesome news but to truly end this nightmare we need to make sure the entire world is vaccinated so variants are not spread around the globe!
1/1	Awesome! I am really happy for you!
1/1	Awesome! I can‚Äôt wait to get a COVID vaccine someday!
1/1	Awesome! We won't have another summer ruined!
1/1	Awesome!! We all get vaccinated too!!
1/1	Awesome, I'll take 1 vaccine and $1400.00. Honestly, just make the vaccine available, I really hate that organization of nationwide distribution has been such shit.
1/1	BBC is always quality, good information about the vaccine. Hope everyone takes it. I hope to get it in May
0/0	BBC lies 89% of the time according to top scientists
0/0	BEWARE!! What is good news about SKIPPING TESTING?? It's not going to "put this to bed"!!! i was flu vaccine injured in 2012 - in short, it took me 3 years to be able to use a fork and a knife again to eat. it was horrific, the worst experience of my entire life. I am now disabled, will never work again and have permanent neurological damage - I have constant neuropathic pain. it took EIGHT YEARS to go thru the "Vaccine Court" process only to win a fraction of my losses. If you are damaged by the COVID vaccine, you are screwed. You are not protected and you will be damaged. If you get the flu, you won't die!!! If you do, it's your time. I would rather have died than live the life I have with constant pain, unable to do things I love, unable to work. My condition will worsen as I age and I will suffer more and more and more. DON'T GET THE VACCINE!!

1/1	Based on current knowledge, experts believe that COVID-19 vaccines are unlikely to pose a risk to a person trying to become pregnant in the short or long term
1/1	Based on what has been proved about vaccines for other diseases, the COVID-19 vaccine may help keep you from getting seriously ill, even if you do get the virus

0/0	Basically what she's saying, using WAY too many words is, we have this stuff we're going to inject you with and we have absolutely NO idea if it will help or if it will do anything at all. In reality, it's no more than a placebo to give people a false sense of safety.
0/0	Basically what they're saying is "We have no idea about the long-term health risks and in any case we won't be held accountable but just trust us and get the jab

1/1	Because in the end, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) avoided Trump‚Äôs attempts to play politics with our safety. Thank you to the FDA career professionals
0/0	Because it doesn't work, FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY...VACCINE RUSHED TO PISH POLITICAL AGENDA, MORE PEOPLE WILL SUFFER AND DIE BC OF IGNORANCE AND SELFLESSNESS
0/0	Because it is a brand new vaccine, and needs at least 4-10 years to prove it is safe. This one has been rushed out too soon, period end of story.
0/0	Because it took them less than a year to develop it. Seems a bit fishy, like they had covid planned.
1/1	Because it will be a communal and healing experience: to wait our turn, to make sure the people who need it the most get it first, to do something as a country all at once, to watch the herd immunity build in all of us. To crush this bug, we need to all do it together
1/0	Because not all the vulnerable CAN be vaccinated, as shown in this very news item. There's no proof yet that the vaccine doesn't reduce your ability to infect others.
0/0	Because not everyone thinks it's a miracle... some people think its damaging ... I'm not getting it unless I see there are no side effects....
0	Because of your timing to announce this after the election, me and about 70 million other Americans will boycott Pfizer for eternity
0/0	Because the long term effects of these vaccines are impossible to assess because it hasn't been tested long term. That's undeniable.
0/1	Because the mRNA approach to vaccines is new, you might have seen claims and worries about what might happen after it‚Äôs injected into the body.
0/-1	Because why take an unproven, experimental vaccine that doesn't prevent Covid-19, where we're being told that we would STILL need to wear a mask and social distance even after getting it!?
1/1/1	Been Covid positive twice already,have auto immune disease and had my first dose of covid jab! Hurrah! I'm still alive!

1/1	Bless you WHO, I cant wait to take the vaccine
1/1	Blessed to get my first dose of the vaccine tomorrow! Excited to help build herd immunity and get us closer to the end of this
1/-1	Bodies after vaccinated be like: we meet again... for the first time.
0/0	Booster I'm not taking the first give mine to someone who wants it
0/0	Boosters and annual vaccinations. Big pharma having an absolute field day with this scamdemic.
1/1	Both Moderna and Pfizer, whose vaccines use an mRNA platform, found their vaccines to be about 95% effective. The AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine showed a somewhat lower efficacy, but is less expensive and poses fewer issues involved in distribution and administration
1/1	Both Pfizer and Moderna report that their vaccines show approximately 95% efficacy at preventing both mild and severe symptoms of COVID-19.
1/1	Both doses only made my arm super sore for 2 days each. Some people I work with have had zero reaction to either shot
1/1	Both my parents got their first #COVIDVaccination today and 2021 feels just a little brighter to me.
1/1	Both my parents got vaccinated this morning Mum said it was so well organised and everyone involved was lovely
1/1	Both my parents have had their first jab. Both rough for 24 hours after it. Ill be having it as soon as I'm allowed
1/1	Both natural immunity and immunity produced by a vaccine are important aspects of COVID-19 that experts are investigating
1/1	Both of my elderly parents have got the vaccine. So relieved I could cry.
1/1	Both of my parents have had at least their first dose and it's a huge relief!
1/1	Both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines have completed phase three trials that were far larger (30k and 44k respectively) and more robust than almost any vaccine that has come before so I‚Äôd say you should stay away from the keyboard and not write anything about something you obviously have ZERO understanding of.

1/-1	Britain on Thursday launched a trial to assess the immune responses generated if doses of the COVID-19 vaccines with 2 different mechanisms (Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca Plc) are combined in a two-shot schedule.

0/0	Buck parker seriously. Info from cnn. Yeah no. There's doctors who say dont get it because of way better reasons than cnn. But at least you has good reasons
0/0	But a total of 23 deaths have been reported out of 25000 people vaccinated. That's sounds worse than what the corona virus death rates are.
1/1	But any vaccine is better than covid without vaccine right? If it is effective against serious illnesses and death then what is the problem?
0/0	But as a 30 year old adult who is highly dubious about the whole Covid thing and especially the super fast creation of a vaccine . No i won't .
0/0	But do u know the long term effects? Do you know? Look at the hpv vaccine
0/-1	But even as vaccines are being rolled out, there‚Äôs little agreement on the exact sequence of priority groups.
1/1	But first, let‚Äôs talk about the second dose real quick. The second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine got to me.
1/0	But if four people with Covid had died of heart attacks and old age you can bet that it would have been attributed exclusively to Covid and not the preexisting conditions. When people die from vaccines suddenly it's all about the preexisting conditions
0/0	But in the 21st century and under a powerful supposed drug industry led health services ... he had under lying conditions? In UK 60000 deaths THEY SAY from covid ... that they can't even prove exists? Independent well respected laboratories in America failed to find ANY covid in 1500 tested positive but did find Influenza! Did you know that such as Diabetes and some cancers etc are CAUSED by the Epstein Barre Virus that doctors don't want to talk about ? I was told for 30myears to live with it and take mountains of antibiotics ... until an holistic Canadian doctor in USA told me that can be dealt with and promptly did so ... 4 weeks of taking a mix of certain herbs! If you have any condition that you are living with ... get tested for EBV! Doctors all too often LIE and those advising government are doing just that in order too make billions from those fake chinese vaccines!
0/0	But it is said to be 52% effective from what I heard from Prof Gray yesterday. What exactly do we want from this vaccine, is it not to protect us from covid19 and all its different variants?
1/1/1	But my coworkers say that the vaccines still have the same death rate as the virus. First off I dont believe anything that comes out of their mouths. Second where do these people get their "information "?
0/-1	But now the left can‚Äôt wait to have their vaccines. I still remember when kommila was adamant about not taking it because it‚Äôs ‚Äútrumps vaccine‚Äù.
1/1	But scientists remain confident it will protect against serious disease.' And that's exactly who we should be listening to to. Not the small study as stated above.
1/1	But that's what thousands of people are doing for us right now to try and find you a vaccine without side affects that works.
1/1	But the people who can't take the vaccine, due to a bad immune system, can die if not enough people take it. This is not about us as individuals, it is about humanity as a whole.
0/0	But they are the first mRNA vaccines. Really a coincident? I would expect some mRNA vaccines for other preventable diseases before this one.
0/-1	But they have not seen the data of the side effects but they are advertising the vaccine already.
0/0	But they or someone they live with might get sick from a virus or bacteria that they picked up around the time they got vaccinated.
1/0	But to be fair studies have shown vaccines cause autism. Because you need to be alive to get it
1/1	But vaccines will soon make a big difference to transmission, where billions of doses will be available over the next few months
0/0	But wait, Joe said he had a plan..no nevermind, he doesn't..but wait, the vaccine is the answer, nope, wrong again...masks work, ummm, well, questionable at best....oh I know, lockdowns, surely THAT will do the trick, well sh!t, wrong again! So are the days of our lives....üòÇü§∑ü§¶
1/1	But you are not talking about the real issue about these vaccines, their availability for every single human being on the planet, currently these vaccines are not even accessible to half of the global population on Earth because, they are very expensive to afford, it sucks...
0/0	But you can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs better than getting Covid when a third have no symptoms and the vast majority of the rest have mild symptoms - I‚Äôve had Covid twice now and only had a mild cough. I won‚Äôt be having the vaccine. I‚Äôm not anti vax but i am pro safety-too many unknowns for me
0/0/0	By CDC's own numbers recovery rates are higher than the vaccine effectiveness. ...I'll pass
1	By February end all 'interested' healthcare workers would have taken shot. Rest will do so as & when they wish in future. Govt. has done its part of vaccinating them on priority. Time now to shift focus on other frontline workers.
1/1/1/1	By God I never thought I'd see the day
1/1	By God‚Äôs grace, I got the CoviShield-AstraZeneca vaccine today. It‚Äôs a relief since I‚Äôll be living again with my 94-year-old grandma in 2 weeks.
1/1	By not getting the vaccine you put other people, including your loved ones, at risk. This is as reckless as drunk driving.
0/1	By slowing the spread of Covid which is a relatively harmless virus, you are giving it chances to mutate and therefore inhibiting herd immunity.
0/0	By taking that vaccine you still won't be protected! You don't even know the risk!
0/-1	By your own explanation, since I've already had the virus the mRNA has already done it's thing, therefore the vaccination will do nothing for me that my body hasn't already done. Yes?

1/1	COVID-19 can have¬†serious, life-threatening complications,¬†and there is no way to know how COVID-19 will affect you. Inject the vaccine to protect you.
1/1	COVID-19 disproportionately impacts the health of people from marginalized groups. Members of these groups are. Not curbing the spread of COVID-19 entails added suffering for members of these groups who are already victims of historic and current injustices
0/0	COVID-19 has a 99.97% survival rate. These are great chances. Vaccines introduce unknowns. Without long-term evidence, there are no promises there won‚Äôt be yet unknown side effects which will be devastating. It can‚Äôt possibly be known until they‚Äôve been applied for a long time.I will not get a COVID vaccine.
1/1	COVID-19 is not a hoax. Wear a mask. Social distance. Don't go to an in-person Super Bowl Party. Get the vaccine when you can. The Lord bless you and keep you.
1/1	COVID-19 lessons from Israel after 4 lockdowns (depending how you count) and ~30% of people vaccinated: Lockdowns work only if you actually lock things down, vaccines are safe and work well if you actually get vaccinated, transparency is key, fake news & lying = bad
1/1	COVID-19 vaccination will help protect you by creating an antibody (immune system) response without having to experience sickness.
1/1	COVID-19 vaccination works by teaching your immune system how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19, and this protects you from getting sick with COVID-19.
1/1	COVID-19 vaccine drive may prove to be the biggest health movement in the history of mankind. To help the Government roll it out smoothly, organizations of all industries, sectors, and sizes have stepped up.

0/0	Coronavirus is a general term for seasonal colds and flus and because of the mutating nature of the virus lifecycle there has never been a vaccine - in fact any vaccine can take many years to develop - they never found a cure for the common cold after forty years of trying and a chicken pox vaccine took almost twenty years to develop. A vaccine produced this quickly has not been tested properly - those who get vaccinated will be basically guinea pigs for any new vaccine.

0/0	DON'T GET THE VACCINE My friend got covid and recovered in just a few days. Nothing super significant about that right? Wrong! He has CF (cystic fibrosis) which is a major issue with the lungs. Research says that people with pre-existing diseases WILL die if they get covid. Like I said, he was fine. He told me it was nothing more than an intense flu. In just a few days, he got over it. One last thing, HE DID NOT HAVE THE VACCINE. Besides, do people really know what is actually in this Vaccine? This could be the easiest way ever that whoever made these "vaccines" take over the world. All they would need to have done is put some sort of devise in with the vaccine that enables them to access the brain, and ta da, they take over. (Just sayin.)

1/1	Even if it was in the vaccine it would be a version of the virus that wouldn‚Äôt be able to actually infect us. It‚Äôs what we‚Äôve been doing for years. And that fever you get from a vaccine sometimes isn‚Äôt because you‚Äôve been infected by the virus in the vaccine. It‚Äôs because your immune system is functioning normally! That‚Äôs what‚Äôs supposed to happen. Fevers aren‚Äôt caused by infections; they‚Äôre part of your body‚Äôs response to what‚Äôs infected it (or what it thinks it‚Äôs infected by, in the case of certain vaccines).

0/0	Every doctor will back the COVID vaccine. I will not be getting it and will never trust anything that Bill Gates is involved with.
1/1	Every drug has side effects, you should read viagra warnings.
1/-1	Every last person is all about drama and making everything worse and taking everything out of context
1/1	Every one of us has been getting vaccinated since we were infants and that you are still alive so you can be paranoid is pretty solid proof your fear of this one is as dumb as it gets.
1/0	Every person who gets two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine decreases her own probability of dying if COVID-19 by over 95%. Additionally, as part of the pool of humanity, she decreases the probability COVID-19 death of each individual in her extended circle by a small amount.
1/1	Every pill you ever took had a long list of potential side effects, have the vaccine
1/1/1	Every shot in the arm is another step toward stopping #COVID and ending this pandemic.
1/1	Every single Covid vaccine is more effective than the annual ‚Äòflu vaccines. Media outlets need to stop irresponsible reporting merely to generate headlines
1/1	Every vaccine has a side effect, it's nothing new. With the vaccines, all you'll get is a sore arm and nothing more. It's better than having covid.
1/1	Every vaccine has side effects. Prescription meds have more and far worse side effects. The vaccine side effects are called your immune systems learning the virus and creating antibodies. Serious vaccine injuries are very rare.
1/1	Every year we have to rollout a new flu vaccine because the virus mutates, but we get on with life because the vaccines are there for it. New we have the same for Covid-19 the same can be applied, we can‚Äôt live like the last year forever.
0/0	Everybody ain‚Äôt getting the same shot! They ant fooling nobody!
1/0	Everybody is sitting here downgrading the vaccine because they're afraid to take it or just plain idiots would you rather deal with the covid-19 and be put into an induced coma in the hospital and your family not knowing if you'll make it boy can't we be smarter
1/1	Everybody should take the vaccine
1/1	Everybody that does not take the vaccine will die
1/1	Everybody's different ..but I had both shots already, you don't even feel it ..and I didn't have any side effects.. best shot i ever got!
1/1	Everyone I know who have had the vaccine had no side effects at all. Can‚Äôt wait to have mine. I want to see my family soon.
1/1	Everyone I work with is ready and willing to get the vaccine, and we're in biotech.

1/1	Everyone get your damn vaccine so I can be a part of the herd immunity since I'm "medically unable" to get it!!!
1/1	Everyone have to be careful about this virus it‚Äôs real,have seen people who‚Äôs been affected by it. Hope the vaccine works as the say too
1/-1	Everyone is talking about how bad or mild this disease is when they get it, but they're not even discussing the lasting side effects from having covid. We see people with lasting cardiac and pulmonary issues after having covid. Too many people concerned with the possible long term effects of getting the vaccine but not concerned with what happens to your body after having covid.
1/1	Everyone knew the EU Commission would totally fail. Arguing 3 mths in price when AZ giving this vaccine away practically for Free! Only the Commission could screw this up.... love the German media reaction to VdL trying to blame others.. Uk vaccinate 10,000,000. With AZ Oxford now proven excellent for over 65s And prevents virus transmission
1/1	Everyone must take the vaccine. its very important. it should compulsory to the citizens...

0/0	Everyone's infected except you and me and everyone we know...............
0/-1	Everyone: I hope they make something soon to end the spread When the vaccine is announced: I‚Äôm not taking it until everyone else does
1/1	Everyone‚Äôs body is going to react differently to the Covid-19 vaccine...yes there have been a few bad or really bad things happen but it is mostly positive
1/1	Everything has risk!!! You know what else causes cancer? breathing. Stop doing that if you don't want to get cancer.
0/0	Everything you put in your body from pharmakeia is harmful. Side effects just differ from person to person. I will never take any vaccine but for those that do No reason to get a vaccine for a virus with a 99.97% recovery rate.
0/0	Evidence that the Co-vid 19 vaccines are not safe is mounting. I have often thought that the Wuhan Virus is-- or is related to-- a biological weapon. I'm not letting it into my body via a shot.
0/0	Evil thing. I refuse any vaccines
0	Evil vaccine
0/0	Ew. Never
0/0	Exactly if the makers don't believe in their product enough to take responsibility for damage from their product no thank. Don't try to shame me for not taking it you deal with it if you get damaged from taking it.
1/1	Exactly why schools can wait to open. Vaccines first.
0/0	Exactly! And they want us to take a vaccine that alters your dna. A vaccine that they aren‚Äôt even sure prevents transmission etc. they don‚Äôt even know I. Which ways it is effective fully so who knows what crazy side effects it has? With a survival rate so high, the risk is ok with me.
0/0	Exactly! It's fucken suspicious. It's not even a 'vaccine' they can't guarantee it will prevent covid. What is the real agenda here? Population sterilisation?!
1/1	Exactly. I believe in vaccines but I don't want to be the first in line for the COVID vaccine(s). Why? Because all of these vaccines currently undergoing trials were developed exceptionally fast using new techniques. But yes, I most certainly will get vaccinated.
0/0	Exactly. how can we trust the medical industry when it's main motive is money. all they want is money.
1/1	Excellent , we need that vaccine in Europe now
1/1	Excellent description of how the mRNA Covid vaccine works and how it was designed to maximize the efficiency of the translation into spike proteins and to evade destruction by the immune system at the time of injection.
1/1	Excellent news! I'm hoping i can be one of the people who gets this early. My wife is pregnant and my biggest fear in life is having her catch it from me and potentially losing her and our child!
1/1	Excellent news, hopefully this gets approved within the next two-two and a half weeks and we can start getting these into arms by late February!
1/1	Excellent news. I can't wait for my family and friends and myself to get this treatment.... Everyone stay safe and take care until then.

0/1	Experimental vaccine delivered w/o legal recourse for injuries...gee, what can go wrong?
1/1	Experimental vaccine? Its been tested on thousands, and proven to work.You seem to be the nut job here.
1/1	Experts continue to conduct more studies about the effect of COVID-19 vaccination on severity of illness from COVID-19, as well as its ability to keep people from spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
0/0	Explain how a protein strand found in Ebola, another sequence found in SARS-2 and finally the use of a Corrona virus as a delivery mechanism is called COVID-19??? Naturally occuring? Not in a million years...the fact it is only RNA single stranded protein tells you this was assembled. This is a man made virus, released by accident or malicuous intent is all we need know now.
0/0	Explain why Pfizer have been given ‚Äòexemption from liability.‚Äô
0/0	Explain why you get a sore throat from the vaccine and all the symptoms of having the virus. That can only happen if it is invading cells
0/0	Extremely low risk if u see 50. Like a 0.00005% mortality rate. With that little risk, I am not going to take a vaccine that alters my DNA.
1/1	Extremely sad to see people saying vaccine is unsafe. I welcome it

1/1	FINALLY A VACCINE YAY!!!!
1/1	FINALLY, WE'RE GETTING OUR VACCINES
1/1	FIRE them for being stupid. Unless you have a history of severe allergies and anaphylaxis you should be getting the vaccine. These people will go straight to hell for their selfishness and putting other at risk.

1/1	Fantastic. The sooner the FDA Grants Johnson&Johnson emergency use authorization the sooner we can start to alleviate critical Supply Shortages.
0/0	Fatigue, fever, headache and aching limbs are also not uncommon in the first three days after vaccination.
1/1	Fauci isn't always a reliable source of information, but he is completely correct on this point. The J&J vaccine provides a high degree of protection against moderate to severe cases and is 100% effective in preventing hospitalizations and deaths. It is also a lot easier to distribute than Pfizer / Moderna since it doesn't need to be kept as cold and it is only a single dose. The J&J vaccine needs to be approved and distributed ASAP.
0/0	Fauci received his vaccine , seems to be affecting him as time goes on, he`s slowly dying of this injection
0/0	Fauci the Fraud
0/0	Fauci ‚Äòseriously doubts‚Äô Russia vaccine is ready for widespread use

1/1	Finally, watched. Very interesting! Thank you again for bringing us clear and well explained information without the biased politics! And Thanks Dr Kim for your continuous efforts to develop a vaccine.
1/1	Finally. Can't wait to get this to the masses. Give the mRNA to the older generation and this to the youngans since it protects them better.
1/1	Finaly things can go back to normal
1/-1	Find a dr who says donot get this vaccine..l
1/1	Find it weird that the fervent supporters of herd immunity don‚Äôt actually want herd immunity now that‚Äôs it can be achieved with a vaccine.
1/1	Find your place in the vaccine line! Hope see you in the vaccine line soon!
1/1	Fine anti-vaxxers, we won‚Äôt blame the virus if it kills you guys; well just blame your poor choice.
1/0	Fine. Don‚Äôt take the vaccine. Enough people will take it to counter your ignorance. Just don‚Äôt expect to be allowed to travel across any international borders.
1/1	Finished my second round of phyzer (spl?) over a week ago. First round, a little soreness, second round a little more soreness and a day of feeling a bit tired. Very happy I was eligible and willing.

0/0	First mRna vaccine in history, with side effects monitored for less than 365 days. No thanks, I won't be a guinea pig for this mass gene therapy.
0/0	First of all, It is not "safe"..people have actually died from it....GLHF Dont trust the robots
0/0	First use the corrupt politicians as guinea pigs!!
1/1	First vaccination tomorrow, which is great. Only 1/5 of my elderly vulnerable family vaccinated, which isn't great. Hearing so many stories of failure to provide the infrastructure for mass vaccinations.
1/1	First vaccine done!
0/0	First you both inject this tasty mRNA vaccine, upload your video of both doses.
0/0	First, don‚Äôt talk to us as we are clueless kids. Second, I watched this video till the end just to hear your main argument for safety is ‚Äú science is awesome?‚Äù Common. For the first time in history you tell the human cell to produce a foreign particle that the immune system detects as threat, and all you have to say is ‚Äúawesome‚Äù ? This is the main reason why folks are concerned and there is absolutely no credible explanation offered as to how this mechanism of artificial manipulation of human cell to manufacture a part of the virus is safe, ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and harmless.
0/0	Flu is down 98% this season with it being relabeled covid19
1/0	Flu shots are free. Why wouldn't Covid shots be?
0/0	Flu yes covid no. I will not get that for my children. That vaccine could have dangerous long term effects. I for one don't want to make that decision for my children.
1/-1	Followed this account ages ago with my mates as a joke but this isn't funny. This virus has killed over 100,000 people. Stay safe and stop spreading bullshit
1/1	For a vaccine we're looking at 12-18 months üòû
1/1	For all the anti-vaccine kids reading the comments , don't be scared the rest us who're all vaccinated we'll keep you safe :)
1/1	For all the negative people on here. Shut up . Be well happy there is a vaccine !
1/1	For anyone who wants their lives back, take the vaccine.
1/1	For every kid who died because of vaccines 1000 died because the lack of it
1/1	For everyone saying they ‚Äúwon‚Äôt take a rushed vaccine‚Äù, none of this was rushed. They just accelerated the process with the use of newer technology. They still had many trials and errors, many different vaccines that made it through and many that did not. Stop trying to ‚Äúspread awareness‚Äù of a fact that isn‚Äôt even true.
1/1	For gods sake the scientists know their work, its been tested thoroughly!!
0/0	For more than 15years the vaccine for HIV has not been found, how possible can it be for this corona lasting for a year and some good months to be found, let's take heart.
1/1	For now we don't have othewise other than taking the risk
1/1	For once in my life I find myself agreeing with Boris Johnson. This won't become a habit. We all knew this virus would mutate over time and it will do so again. The important thing is to keep faith in the vaccine for otherwise we are defeated.
1/1	For once, my state is at the top of the good lists, when we are mostly at the bottom. We have the third highest rate of vaccination rollouts of any other state so far. I personally have had both doses of the vaccine now and I'm not over 65 nor am I in a frontline position. I'm so hopeful now :)
0/-1	For some health-care workers, experience in an industry that seems to put profits over patients and staff contributes to hesitancy about the COVID-19 vaccines.
1/1	For sure! But I‚Äôd be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt nervous
1/1	For sure. I'm positive now and it freaking sucks. I couldn't eat without throwing up and just washing dishes feels like running a marathon.
0/0	For the love of God, stop pushing these vaccines!
1/1	For the record I am still patiently waiting for the Vaccine I got last week to turn me into a 5G Cell phone tower. All you people on the internet said it have computer chips in it and I am in serious need of better cell service at my house.. But zero damned change in signal, just some crappy immunity.
1	For the sake of the people around me i will, but im not very inclined to...
0/0	For the time being, no. I am over 65, overweight and need knee replacement surgery (before you jump to conclusions, I had an injury 33 years ago BEFORE I became overweight and have had 4 surgeries on that knee. Over the years I have gained weight because I could no longer be as active as I had been).
1/1	For those anti vacciners because I know there are some here lurking. I‚Äôll give you the benefit of the doubt side effects and such and such but would you rather die of covid?
1/1	For those who do not trust the shot. I will take it for you.
1/1	For transparency and for the peace of mind for everyone, I think we should have Moderna and Pfizer vaccines
0/0	Forcing people to have invasive medical treatment is wrong.
1/1	Forecasters predicting 2 feet of snow in greater Philly area...our first Philly blizzard and our generator has not yet been installed. This could get interesting...Hope I can get to my COVID vaccine appointment on Thursday.
1/1	Forget about all the doubters...they always want the worse or the worst for the whole globe but for me I am already in with the V-sign from here in Kenya! Some guys are always just there to critisize every achievement when they are non-partisan themselves!There is a vaccine out there and I eagerly waith for it...Thank you WHO for the legal approvals after a very very long period of months!
0/-1	Forget the experimental vaccine. We are missing a huge and important piece of data by not having the antibody test readily available. How many of us have already had it? 70% of those who tested positive were asymptomatic- which means the denominator of those infected is likely way bigger than we know - making the actual death percentage completely unreliable.
0/0	Fortune cookie has higher chance of prediction than these experts.

1/1	Getting my second dose of Moderna tomorrow morning. With a background in public health and infectious diseases, I have followed the prior development of mRNA delivery technology, and I was delighted that it was applied early to bring vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to market. Now, to see if my immune system will actually develop antibodies unlike during my contact with the virus last spring.

1/1	Getting the vaccine cuts down the infection chain!
0/0	Getting the vaccine means getting the virus! I ain't gonna keep up with this shit!

1/1	Good news I'm going for my Covid vaccine jab today. First step to travelling again..
1/1	Good news no doubt, but lets not kid ourselves that these vaccines will be a magic bullet that'll immediately return the world to 'normal'. It'll take months, perhaps even years, to get everyone vaccinated. Covid-19 will become endemic (it's virtually impossible to completely eliminate a virus once it's 'out'), so we'll still have to be careful.

If you feed your body the right foods you won't need a nasty vaccine...oregano oil, black seed oil, zinc, iodine, krill oil, Molasses, cinnamon etc etc...these are the things our body needs, along with lots of fruits and vegetables...with them our body lacks nothing...I take them every day.....they strengthen your immune system as well as repair any ailments in the body...I was on doctor's prescribed poison for years, I stopped taking them and started taking the above mentioned oils and foods, now I feel so much better, no side effects at all....There's absolutely NO NEED for vaccines, To hell with the nasty deadly vaccines

0/0	Has anyone yet mentioned these are not really vaccines, rather they supposedly minimise the effects of COVID if you get it. There is no evidence that if you're vaccinated you don't pass on the disease as supposedly asymptomatic people do. Oh well...
0/0	Has he had the vaccine üíâ? He can have mine for free!
0/0	Has the vaccine been tested on pregnant women because the timeline suggests it has not
0/0	Has there been enough testing?
0/0	Has there been enough time to test the side effects?? All this is evil.
0/0	Hate the war on drugs, not the people using them. Prohibition hasn‚Äôt prevented drugs from entering the country or people from using them. It‚Äôs actually created more dangerous drugs, overdose, addiction and stigma. The war on drugs isn‚Äôt ending harms, it‚Äôs causing them!
1/1	Have people seen how one mutation, eg the one in England, can affect the population? We need vaccinenation to stop this!
1	Have people seen the caos at the hospitals? All of this can be stopped with vaccination
1/1	Have the anti-Vaxxers lost their way to this video? Don't see a lot of down votes. I understand some people are allergic to science and make up any anecdote and conspiracy to deny it.
1/1	Have the life saving vaccine or stay inside forever so you don't potentially infect or kill others . Vaccine equals freedom.
0/-1	Have you been getting any desire to eat brains or has your temperature plummeted recently?
0/0	Have you ever seen a vaccine pushed like this for an illness that has a greater than 99% survival rate? What could this really be about?
1/1	Haven't our nurses been through enough?
0/-1	Haven‚Äôt gotten the vaccine yet, but I did get accepted into a Covid community research study. The biggest side effect I‚Äôve noticed so far is smugness that lingers for several days.
1/1	Having a vaccine that is somewhat effective is better than no vaccine at all
1/1	Having had COVID-19 March during the first wave I‚Äôll happily have the vaccine please
0/0	He didn‚Äôt mention all the ingredients.. it‚Äôs not just water, sugar and fat.. Lies
0/0	He don‚Äôt even vaccinated his kids, why is he giving this poison? Oh I forgot it‚Äôs all about population.
0/0	He even says ...‚Äôacts just like our immune system...‚Äô WE ALREADY HAVE AN IMMUNE SYSTEM, so WHY would we need dirty gates mRNA vaccines , we don‚Äôt, NOT required
0/0	He forgets to mention all the animals they tested it on died
0/-1	He has no symptoms but everyone else has so many weird side affects that are unexplained.
0/-1	He said protect you against sars cov 2?
0/0	He said the vaccine is safe but doesn't care in Norway or other countries people died from the vaccine.
0/0	He said we need to trust the vaccine lol coz we can't trust anything they have said so far . Keep your vaccine
1/1	He's lucky to have his vaccine, I'm at risk, I'm 59 years old and I don't have a vaccine, bravo!!!!
0/0	He's not the ony one to die. I will never get that vaccine !
1/1	Heads up, naysayers: the vaccine is working. Hope at last!
0/0	Health cannot be injected.
0/0	Health care worker dies after second dose of #COVID #vaccine.
1/1	Health care worker here. Words can't describe how happy I am! This is one of the greatest scientific achievements of the century and I can't wait to get the vaccine once it comes out!
1/1	Health doesn‚Äôt come in the form of a vaccine. It literally does though?
1/1	HealthAccessTp explains no shortcuts were taken to approve #CovidVaccines. Pfizer & Moderna trials had proper sample sizes of 30,000 individuals each. Side effects were properly monitored for 60-days during the trial period. Millions have now been vaccinated, let's celebrate.
0/0	Healthcare workers know better than anyone the truth about the virus, they don‚Äôt see a dire need for a vaccine.
0/0	Hearing that the person got Transverse myelitis and paralysis of hands and feet. It would not be the first time that these type of sars vaccine had that side effect. We have to wait
0/0	Heartbreaking. 23 people died within days of 1st Pfizer dose. 13 deaths due to common reactions, incl. fever/nausea, ‚Äúmay have contributed to fatal outcome in some frail patients".
0/0	Heck No!!!!!
0/0	Heck No!!!!! I dont trust that vaccine
0/0/0	Heck no you should not get it. It is full of harmful chemicals. This has all been planned to get chemicals into us. They want to destroy our bodies.
0/0/0	Heeeeell no don‚Äôt take it lol
0/0	Heeeeell no don‚Äôt take it lolüëÅ
1/1	Held off until I fully recovered from COVID, but I got my 1st dose of the vaccine today!!!
0/0	Hell NO !
0/0	Hell na I'm no test subject for your "vaccine" your not sure about that will truly work with out messing up my health I'll rather die then be a lab rat for your experiments flock that sht
0/0	Hell naw the government play to many Games with our lives.. I'm not taking it. üò†
0/0	Hell naw, doctors and nurses have already died taking the vaccine. I‚Äôll stick to social distancing and boosting my immune system. No no and no
0/0	Hell no ! ! !
0/0	Hell no .They couldn't pay me to take it.
0/0	Hell no. It's unsafe and only reduces systems.
0/0	Hell yes! Since the WHO declared war on anyone who wants freedom to decide what goes into their family's bodies this has become more important than ever. Thank you for giving us a voice!
1/1	Hello I hope the vaccine will work all over the UK
1/1	Hello everyone am from airzona am thinking of getting the vaccine should i get it or not am kinda nervous üò∂ has anybody gotten it yet what the symptoms
1/1	Hello! I was waiting for you information on this vaccine. Thank you, always appreciate the science and research that you convey in your videos. Greetings from South Florida....
0/0	Hells NO!!!!
0/0	Hells NO!!!! I aint taking no shot
0/0	Hence the adverse reactions. Everyone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s genetic make up differs. This nano tech can deduce each one. I think not. Common sense
1/1	Her being against vaccines because she had a bad reaction, is like someone say is against exercise and is bad for you, because she sprained her ankle once.
1/1	Herd immunity for the win
0/1	Herd immunity is great if it's through vaccines. Herd immunity without immunisation is just letting everyone get infected. Literally no rational person can find logic in that.
1/0	Herd immunity is our way out of this crisis!
1/-1	Here in Bosnia I had already seen several cases of rheumatic fever and a case we thought was miliary tuberculosis, diseases now rare in America. It was sobering to think that the mundane process of vaccinating these children might ultimately save more lives than any UN-brokered peace treaty.
1/0	Here in Brexitland we need a vaccine against the far-right taking over. Then we can ditch brexit and get back some humanity instead of all this populist 'euro-hate'.
0/0	Here is how this pandemic of corona virus works: 1- medical billionaires with scientist create a virus in labs 2- they release the virus 3- they make a vaccine 4- they urge gov to sell the vaccine 5- they make billions by making everyone get a vaccine
0/0/0	Here's the reason I'll refuse to take it, and it didn't dawn on me until just last night: How were we able to come up with a vaccine for a brand new disease in 9 months, yet scientists have been trying to centuries (and still haven't succeeded) to find a cure for cancer?
0/0	Here's the reasons I'll never get the vaccine. 1) c19 data isn't scary 2)I don't trust big pharma and their paid Scientists. Especially when they, big tech and the media ban other Scientists from speaking 3) The constant lies from corrupt Scientists and politicians 4)I'm not 75 with heart and lung issues. Cheers
0/0	Heresy in 21 century. One cannot ask questions about pfizer vaccine. It actually says a lot. A silence louder than words....
1/1	Here‚Äôs to all the morons that think that COVID is a hoax üëè Why is it so damn hard to just follow the rules? Wear a mask, social distance. Let‚Äôs stop the spread and hope that 2021 is much better than 2020.
0/-1	Hes actually an ai
0/0	Hesitant ? As they should be.
0/0	Hesitant?I'm down right terrified
1/1	Hey COVID19, we will bid you goodbye soon.
1/1	Hey everyone, I'm gonna take the vaccine üòò
1/1	Hey everyone, let's all laugh at the antivax boomers in the comments who are disliking the video! Laugh at the clowns!
0/0	Hey guys, I'm new here. Is it a joke or physological test made by government or people are actually stupid enough to believe this "science"?
1/1	Hey so I decided to get the COVID vaccine yesterday I‚Äôm okay my arm is a little sore but it will go away but I feel great with no side effects
1/-1	He‚Äôs been anti mass vaccination from the start of people getting vaccinated for this. Every blip he sees that possibly supports his position immediately goes to his feed. I stopped following because it became too much. Like the boy who cried bad vaccines.
0/-1	He‚Äôs probably getting a placebo- anyway why should we be coerced by media personalities?
1/-1	Hi Dr. Cellini! Thank you for that info.
1/1	Hi Im Jalen and I worked a six hour shift with adverse side effects of the covid vaccine
1/1	Hi WHO thanks for your Important information about Vaccination of Covid 19.
1/1	Hi y‚Äôall! I personally received the vaccine and I made a video about my day and my experience! If this is something that y‚Äôall are interested in come check it out and subscribe for updates!
1/1	Hi! COVID ICU nurse here! Thank you so much for making this video, it is so important to address all the absolute ridiculous misinformation out there. Had my second dose of Pfizer over a week ago, felt a little flu-like for 24 hours, and since then I‚Äôve been 100% fine. I am so thankful to have been able to be vaccinated and hope once it is available to the general public they will be grateful too
1/1	Hi, this video is amazing (going to use it to explain vaccines to my mom). I would just appreciate it if you could write an update in the bio or something? Like which types of vaccines are the new covid vaccines and the thing I am most interested in is: what are the dangers!? I don't feel like any videos highlight the dangers of each? (I want to reassure my mom that we will not die/ become autistic lol).
0/0	High amount of vit. C, Zinc and Vit. D. And you'll be fine.
1/-1	Highly specific delivery of antigens to target cells and high expression of antigen after vaccination
0/0	Historical or not, the use of cells from a baby that was murdered is immoral.
1/1	Historically the vast majority of the vaccines have help the humanity, why do so many have trust issues?
1/1	History in the making - vaccinated and it feels so good!
1/1	History shows doctor the vaccines do work vaccines do wipe out pandemics ignore the haters.
0/0	Hmmm 99.7 % Survival rate 80 % asymptomatic roughly a 30% initial herd immunity for corona. Why the vaccine and why the rush?
0/0	Hmmm let me see Covid 19 , 99.95 survival rate no vaccine for me
0/0	Hmmmm.......yeah ,it‚Äôs going to be a hard no on that one Chief.
0/0	Honestly I‚Äôm very worried about This vaccine. We were rushing to make this vaccine and it was ready in less then a year which is too fast and we should have waited more to see the after affect of the vaccine.
0/0	Honestly, I prefer to get COVID-19 again. Those were my covid symptoms for one day. Looks like the vaccine is worse than the virus itself
0	Honestly, I'd rather risk getting the virus and building my own antibodies.
0/0	Honestly, I'd rather risk getting the virus and building my own antibodies. Humans aren't guinea pigs and regardless of what you say here, plenty of bad side effects have been reported.
0/0	Honestly, I'd rather risk getting the virus and building my own antibodies. So many side affects of the vaccine
1/1	Honestly, been waiting for this vaccine since freaking March, when we all got shut down
1/-1	Honestly, i understand the anti vaccines side, but saying that these vaccines are unsafe is not true, its safe depending on if you have a certain reaction to them, or not. And if you are safe but still dont use them because of this reason... It doesnt make any sense since you're not affected.
1/1	Honestly, just make it required for everything. The government requiring it where they can, and insurers making everyone else require it.
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1	Honestly, when the Coronavirus vaccine becomes available I‚Äôm going to be so happy. The disease killed my grandfather and if I can stop another family from going through the same pain then I‚Äôm down.
1/1	Hope all people get it fast so we are done with this bshit pandemic..
1/-1	Hope everyone gets it
1/1	Hope has arrived! Grateful to get the COVID-19 vaccine this morning. Having witnessed so much suffering these last 9 months, I‚Äôm doing this as much for my patients, family and community as myself.
1/1	Hope soon, it will be in market
0/0	Hope the elderly UK Royal Family don't develop adverse reactions. They were probably given placebos, the risk being too great.
1/1	Hope the haters do not get vaccinated nor crowd the hospitals and deprived others from getting it
1/1	Hope the haters do not get vaccinated nor crowd the hospitals and deprived others from getting it.

1/1	Hope this is still up in October. I will post when I can get the vaccine. Am waiting!
1/1	Hope this is the end of it. Waiting for the jab!!
1/1	Hope this vaccine will comes into Malaysia. We need it too. Many are dying and many had died, yet many are still struggling. Please, consider some quantities for Malaysia.
1/1	Hope we all get it soon.
1/1	Hope we can get this vaccine soon. We need to establish herd immunity to stop this pandemic!
1/1	Hopefully FUNDING made the vaccine production faster. Isn‚Äôt it amazing what science can do when it has money? Let's take it then!
1/1	Hopefully I don't catch covid and die before I get one!
1/0	Hopefully things can ramp up by March, otherwise this is gonna drag on through most of the year there.
1/1	Hopefully this vaccine works, I‚Äôm ready to get back to normal!

1/1	Hopefully this will help get everyone especially the elderly and nurses vaccinated soon.

1/1	Hoping it's the game changer everyone needs.
1/1	Hoping praying this vaccine works and we go back to normal
1/1	Hoping we will end this soon with those vaccines..
1/1	Horrifying to see all anti-vaxxers, we need to be positive to the vaccine in order to get back our normal.
1/1	Hospitals should require it. Refuse? Fired.
0/0	How about NO!
0/0	How about NO! never am I going to that vaccine
0/0	How about all that have died from the vaccine ? In Norway elderly home some 23 people died. Its not safe. Better to get covid 19 and take medication for it. Evermectin or hydroclorocine.
0/-1	How about all the elderlys that died.
0/0	How about deaths in Norway? This is just the beginning
1	How about getting some vaccines into the state as well?
0/0	How about inside the lab that created covid-19

0/0	How about telling us how many died from this vaccine
0/-1	How about the deaths in Norway after vaccine?
1/1	How about we actually get a vaccine before we start worrying about what yahoos won‚Äôt take it.
1/1	How are we supposed to go to the gym without the vaccine?
0/0	How are you can trust scientist if Pfizer producer of vaccines paid ‚Ç¨3 billion for Medling and hiding the fact?
0/0/0	How can I feel secure if the government signed a full disclaimers for vaccine manufacturers in case of side effects??
0/0	How can anyone believe anything when this is a gene therapy shot not a vaccine. Wake up world.
1/1	How can anyone refuse to accept the vaccine? The vaccines have been approved. I and my family wait anxiously for our turn
0/0	How can it possibly be Safe and Effective when the Manufacturers of these Vaccines have "Zero Liability" if Sued for Vaccine Damage or Death.?? NO QUALITY CONTROL.!!
1/1	How can people really believe that a vaccine can change the DNA?
0/0	How can there be any scientific evidence when the information is controlled and taken down? The science we know is their science, one way road. Let us hear the two sides of the story and let people judge for themselves. We have brains. Let us think.
0/-1	How can they find a vaccine for this, but not for cancer or aids etc. And also so quickly?!?!
0/0/0/0/0	How can they find a vaccine for this, but not for cancer or aids etc. And also so quickly?!?! Makes me question everything
0/0	How can u speak for 7 billion people? I bet only the 75% brainwashed will get the vaccine! And have a look how many have been killed thanks to the vaccine!
0/0	How can we compare these mRNA/DNA vaccines to traditional ones when it comes to long term effects, these vaccines are the first of their kind.
1/1	How can you be so stupid to not take the vaccine, literally billions of dollars has been funded for it
0/0	How can you make a vaccine from a virus that has never been isolated? The CDC itself does NOT even have a sample of the isolated virus. Just asking...
0/0	How can you say it's "SO MUCH better than getting Covid"? The vast majority of people who've had the virus had no symptoms whatsover.
0/0	How can you trust a newly developed vaccine? Politicians first, thanks.
0/0	How come are all the deaths or injuries caused by vaccines swept under the carpet? Is there not a civilized way of dealing with the problem? All vaccinations should be voluntary and you would not blame anybody for fatalities.
0/0	How did Bill Gates determine that the vaccine has no permanent side effects? Isn't that the point of long-term studies?
0/0	How do you tell it's really a vaccine instead of saline or something?
0/0	How does it make sense to vaccinate people with a drug that doesn't cure the virus? Its just like the flu shot is not a cure.
0/0	How does the COVID-19 vaccine work? Is it safe? Do you still need to wear a mask after you get vaccinated? All lies!
0/0	How does the Telecommunications and Network has to do with Corona?,We are not stupids we know you want to mobilise the whole world under a massive secret surveillance ,You use Corona as an excuse of executing your Diabolic devilish plans for the approaching Armageddon battle

0/-1	How does this guy know there's no harm from taking the vaccine ?
0/0	How foolish do y'all think we are !!!???
0/-1	How long before the side effects of the COVID vaccine can be seen

0/0	How many more people will you kill with your so called vaccine?!
0/0	How many people will die from the Vaccine but not reported to the public...or already dying. This stinks of a plot
0/0	How many people will die from the Vaccine but not reported to the public...or already dying. This stinks of a plot!

0/-1	How much did Pfizer put in the ad?
0/0/0	How much mercury, aluminum, aborted fetal cells, formaldehyde, polysorbate 80, and MSG will be in the covid vaccine?
1/1	How much vaccine the government currently has should be irrelevant to the calculation. We are going to need a whole lot more vaccine than the government currently has.
0/0	How naive the world is, this isn‚Äôt a vaccine, it just takes us to the hell
0/0/-1	How on Earth most medical "professionals" can call all of these cases a coincidence is beyond me! It's a level of delusional I can't imagine.
0/0/0/0	How safe is it? not safe enough for me to take.
0/0	How scary is that. Multiple vaccines with no guarantee that you won't mutate into some kind of weird creature and you'll still have to be tracked. This is truly a declaration of war.
0/0	How the hell this vaccine was allowed to roll out this fast is incredible.
0/0	How they can come up with vaccines faster then the making of face mask???
0/-1	How they fight the new mutant variants you have no idea!!
0/0	How this whole situation has been handled doesn't lead me to have the most faith.
0/0	How vaccines work? Sure, ... inject you with toxins that hurt you, and make you part of the list of people who may die from this covid that is searching for the right person?
0/0	How was it tested in a large scale against the new variants ;; you told us that they haven‚Äôt been around for long , I trust my immune system , Thanks üôè
0/0/0/0/0/0	How will life saving blood transfusions affect those who receive blood from a vaccinated person? I'm not sold on M-RNA, we do not know long term effects on how it will affect our DNA. It's irresponsible not to question this. I'll take my chances on natural immunity.
0/0	How would you ever know if a Covid-19 vaccine works or not when there are no symptoms or harmful effects from contracting it?
1/1	Huge sense of relief for the whole family by vaccine
1/1	Huge thank you to all involved in vaccine development and deployment- my partner Caroline has her first dose, wonderful team at St James Portsmouth
1/1	Huh...we actually use a'lot of medications from Pfizer at our closed door, private pharmacy. Politics aside, I hope this is the first step to normalcy. I just want to go back to Disneyland and want Comic-Con and Wrestlemania back.
1/1	Humanity has always benefited from new technology, mRNA vaccines is new technology. New things always scare some people but the pros far outweigh the cons
0/0	Hundreds have died from taking the vaccine
1/1	Hundreds of thousands are dead. Just because the majority aren‚Äôt dead doesn‚Äôt stop it from being a big deal. A majority of Americans weren‚Äôt killed on 9/11, for example.
1/1	Hurry up
1/1	Hurry up ! I might get covid !!
1/1	Husband getting Moderna tomorrow:)
0/0	Hydroxy, works fine. A bogus vaccine for a bogus Covid. The sheeple are incredibly misinformed. Just try to sick me. And for the sheeple, bah bah bah bah bah
1/1	I (38) just got vaccinated (1 shot) in Jerusalem.
1	I AM VACCINATED!
1/1	I AM a person living w/ cancer. I WILL advocate for those living w/ cancer to live better & longer. RIGHT NOW, that means fighting for pp w/ cancer to get #COVIDvaccine. None of the cancer science progress will have mattered if COVID kills us. We're high risk even if <65!
1/1	I AM getting the vaccine today - gladly. Anyone who refuses it is a fool.
0/-1	I DEFINITELY DONT WANT PFIZER'S VACCINE. I'LL WAIT A BIT ....
0/0	I READ THE LAB STUDY THEY ARE NOT TELLING YOU..DON'T TAKE IT! ABSOLUTELY NOT. I READ THE LAB STUDIES. THIS IS A DRUG, THERE IS TREATMENTS FOR COVID. WHY WOULD I PUT THE CRAP THAT IS IN THE COVID19 DRUG THAT is HAZARDOUS TO MY HEALTH. THERE IS A 99.6 SURVIVAL RATE FROM COVID, AND MANY BAD SIDEFFECTS, IT PERHAPS LIFE LONG, AND DEATHS FROM THIS SO-CALLED DRUG! IT CAN CAUSE YOUR NUREO TUBE TO SWELL, THINK ABOUT THAT.
1/1	I REALLY HATE THAT I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE SUMMER TO GET IT!!!!!
0/-1	I REALLY appreciate that Dr. Yasmin made the distinction between Anti-Vaxers and Vaccine-Hesitant. Ostracizing and mocking people hesitant to take a vaccine that was developed in an insanely short period of time is counterproductive. I think it is reasonable for people to want more evidence than they might usually require for such a vaccine.
0/1	I THINK ITS A SAFE BET THE VACCINE SAFEGUARDS AGAINST NEW STRAIN AND DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR THE ORIGINAL STRAIN!
0/-1	I Trust no one , not even my shadow

0/0	I WILL NEVER GET THIS VACCINE! It needs more time to develope !
0/0	I WILL NOT GET THE SHOT
0/0	I WOULD RATHER LIVE ON A CYBER DUMP THAN TAKE THIS
1/1	I absolutely love this race in the scie clinic world. But I an hopeful this movement opens more pathways to other viral treatments. Like hiv or flu
1/1	I actually wouldn‚Äôt mind doing this, I‚Äôm already going to be exposed to the virus in school so why not get infected willfully in a controlled environment?
1/1	I agree - every person who gets the vaccination is another break in the chain of contagion.
1/1	I agree about taking the vaccine, because the alternative is to get covid.
1/1	I agree. Let's get them done. We have the vaccines available to get all nurses and all teachers done.
0/0	I agree. Usually clinical trials take at least 9 years to gather robust safety data (observation for side effects) in a variety of various patient groups (elderly, children, pregnant women, patients with specific health conditions, etc.), but this vaccine as been rushed through by the health authorities and granted marketing authorisation (permission to be administered to patients) at such a breakneck speed, it is of a grave concern. That is why we do not need a similar situation as was seen in thalidomide.
0/0	I ain't getting it. Its not tested.
0/0	I ain't gonna take any vaccine!
0/0	I ain't taking no vaccine
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I ain't taking that vaccine even if it cost me my job
1/1	I almost died of flu 7 years ago. Believe me I'll take whatever side effects may possibly happen vs going through what I went through.
1	I almost forgot about how much I loved meeting random weird groups of people while going out w/ my friends, always ending up at some random taco shop (or Denny‚Äôs) at the end. Swapping Snapchat‚Äôs and never seeing them again. I feel like I took it all for granted but those times are coming back soon enough!!
0/0	I already had a positive covid test and know how my body reacts to the infection and it wasn't bad! Who needs a vaccine?
0/0	I already have a perfect designed immune system so I pass. I've never heard of a single person since the virus was discovered talked about good nutrition to prevent a disease. Vaccines has done more harm than good that's the truth.
0/0	I already know that I will never get one because I would like to die a natural death....
1/0	I already mentioned they had to genetically engineer the vaccine to save time. The old way of making a vaccine takes too long, and liberals along with their friends in the mainstream media wanted a vaccine ASAP and were pushing for it, but believed the Trump administration could not make it as fast as claimed, and President Trump is the type of guy that loves to prove people wrong. In fact the vaccine would not have been able to be made so fast if the Trump administration did not remove the regulations that would have slowed down the process. Trump was originally pushing for Therapeutic drugs. Remember whatever Trump is for liberals go against, and change the narrative. They made people think there were no alternatives to treating the virus, and vaccine was the only hope meaning the drugs the Trump administration approved were working. Problem is they made it difficult for doctors to prescribe them, and recommended for emergency use only for the general public.
1/0	I already told my doctor the second they have one for me I want one lol
1/1	I also can‚Äôt wait to get the vaccine I currently have COVID and it sucks and I missed Christmas one thing about working in retail you can possibly get COVID
1/1	I also got the vaccine, Moderna, and 5 days after I felt some inflammation in my axillary lymph nodes.
1/1/1	I also heard a lot of "I'll let other people take it first to see how it goes" turn into I want to get it asap. So far so good
1/1	I also plan on getting the vaccine as soon as I am eligible to do so. Stay Safe
0/0	I always reacted to the flu vaccines, I am not getting the vaccine. I would rather get Covid
1/1	I am 100% pro vaccine though! ~ I would rather deal with a day or two of minor side effects then have to go through covid and possibly have long term issues from it! (also I had no side effects after the first dose, so I was very lucky, this time not so much)
1	I am 100% pro vax. But tbf the percentage of the population, especially boomers, that is on multiple daily drugs is insane and makes me question the medical industry.
1/1/1/1	I am 100% taking it

1/1	I am 54 and I'm getting my second shot tomorrow ,i went with my mother age 80 3 weeks ago,she was one of the first to be vaccinated.
1/1	I am 60 years old when I will get vaccine?

0/0	I am NOT taking that vaccine. I absolutely do NOT trust it for a number of reasons.
0/-1	I am a little bit hesitant
1/1	I am a nurse and i got the vaccine 5 days ago. I have not noticed any side effects at all, except a sore arm. But it was not that sore, and was only sore for about 1 1/2 days. And, in the past, I have had flu shots that made my arm more sore. I am fit and healthy, and have a pretty strong immune system. I got the vaccine because I am more concerned passing COVID to others and about getting COVID and having long term issues. Many who have gotten only minor illness from COVID have had long term issues with micro clots in thier organs. I just think that is a way worse scenario then any possible side effects from vaccine
1/1	I am a part of the Pfizer vaccine trial. I could have gotten it, or I could have gotten placebo. My doses were done in September and October. There was definitely an afternoon after my second dose where I felt like crap. Very tired, stomach felt gross, wanted to just lay on the couch, and I couldn‚Äôt get my body the right temperature. Sweatshirt made me sweat, but t shirt felt freezing. That lasted until I went to bed that night, then I woke up feeling fine.
1/1	I am a physician and very PRO vaccine. But there is no reason the government should be forcing anyone to get one against their will.
0/0	I am afraid of the side effects because the testing should take 2 years

0/0	I am anti vax

0/0	I am at high risk, but I won‚Äôt be standing in line waiting to be vaccinated. Far from it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll turn and run for the hills and hide if I have to!
1/-1	I am autistic, the fact that some parents would let their children die rather than be like me (even though it can't cause autism) is very insulting to be honest
0/-1	I am concern about one thing. Side effects. What are the possible side effects one might get?
1/1	I am convinced, I will get it.
1/1	I am currently working frontline nursing in the UK.After consulting with many other health pro's,I decided to have the vac.I've already had Covid,back in April 2020.Had the vac last Friday,no issues.
0/0	I am deeply concerned about pushing this vaccine through so fast. I, quite frankly, do not want to take this vaccine until it has been in use for quite some time in order to evaluate the side effect profile and how effective it actually is.
1/1	I am definitely getting the vaccine because I want to go back to work!

0/1	I am getting the vaccine. The more I read or hear about it the more I am sure I'll never have it

0/1	I am hoping to, but not be able to get the vaccine.You see, I have an extreme allergy to chicken eggs, and many vaccines contain pieces of a virus that has been incubated in chicken eggs. Thus, they contain the proteins that I am allergic to.
0/0	I am immunocompromised due to being a transplant recipient. I am hesitant about recieving the vaccine.
1/1	I am in high risk category and will get it as soon as I am able to. My mother passed away October 8th with covid.
1/1	I am in no way an anti-vaxxer. Hell, I¬†work¬†in the pharmacuetical industry. I have the upmost confidence in the regulatory agencies worldwide and the rigor at which there studies, by experienced players, are going through. I don't want the first round, either

1/1	I am in the US and receive my second dose next week. I cannot wait for our world to be open again. Until then God bless and keep you all safe and healthy
0/-1	I am legit more terrified of the vaccine at this point. Especially since it's development just HAD to include some sort of "liability clause" in it so you can't sue anyone involved in its creation, even if there becomes a proven, direct, and irrefutable link between illness/death and the vaccine. You need to sue the government itself.
1/1	I am lucky to have an appointment next week.
0/0	I am more "scared" of the vaccine than I am of dying from Covid, yeah. Well said.
0/0/0/0	I am never getting vaccinated with this vaccine.
1/1	I am no expert just a messenger, trust the vaccine
0/0	I am no longer 'trying to dig up evidence to prove' vaccines cause autism. There is already abundant evidence....This debate is not scientific but is political
0/0	I am no vaccine skeptic but the speed at which thus vaccine is developed is very very concerning.Condensung years into months will inevitably result in compromises and we dont know the longterm health consequences...
0/0	I am not about to become any part of a genome experiment
1/0	I am not bothered on the opinion of de Pfeffel, with his degree in Greats, on the efficacy of vaccines. Please keep politicians and similar ignorants out of the loop. I want to hear from qualified experts.
0/0	I am not getting a vaccine for a virus that I have a 98% chance of surviving. That is just plain stupid
0/0	I am not getting it. Healthy people don't need this vaccine. Apparently, people re-infected, and all the current rules will stay for us. Even the test is false according to the SDS and WHO.

0/0	I am not taking it, you can give mine to Biden and Harris. I‚Äôll share not greedy. It‚Äôs against my religious beliefs
0/0	I am not taking it. They can't even develop a vaccine for the flu or cold - both coronaviruses. They're both still with us , and we haven't locked down the planet over those. At the very least , I want to see what occurs to all the sheep who rushed to have an unproven vaccine pumped into their system , and see what develops.
0/-1	I am not taking the vaccine if takes my job too
1/1	I am older and I will take my chances with the vaccine rather than the covid
1/1	I am on the downside run of having Corona (1 quarantine week left) and I wish I had this before I got it. I‚Äôm glad someone is making headway. This virus sucks. So much worse than anything else I‚Äôve had.
0/0	I am one who will be afraid to take an early vaccine like this. Be careful out there
1/0	I am over 40 with kidney disease, and my husband is over 50 with diabetes. We both got covid back in August along with out kids who live with us. Only had a fever for a couple days and some body aches, but nothing bad. I am a nutritionist and we eat very healthy. We upped our intake of zinc, quercetin, vitamin C, vitamin D3, NAC, selenium, drank lots of water and rested. This doesn't have to be a death sentence even for vulnerable people like us.

1/1	I am pro vaccine and encourage everyone to get it but personal choice matters and we cannot remove hospital access for those who don‚Äôt have it.
1/-1	I am pro vaccine and following the vaccines but will not get it until masks not necessary afterward. If they don't believe enough in the vaccine, neither do i.
1/1	I am pro vaccine but am troubled by mandatory unproven vaccines which are experimental. It is contravening the Nuremberg code.
1/1	I am pro vaccine by the way. Vaccines can have side effects just like every other medical treatment. However low the chance of developing side effects is, It is still more likely than dying from Covid. I am under 20.
1/1	I am pro vaccine. I‚Äôve had every vaccine I could get and once i have children, I will have them vaccinated appropriately. I am also pro masks. I think they work to reduce viral load. I just want to clear up confusion.
1/1	I am pro vax, pro Biden, pro mask mandates. But I think its laughable to trust government as the sole source of this data.
1/1	I am proudly vaxxinated. No side effects. :-)
0/0	I am reading this morning that a doctor in Miami and a nurse in Portugal have died after getting the vaccine, and that half of the healthcare workers in California are refusing it. So no, I'm not taking it.
1/1	I am ready for the vaccine whenever my age group is allowed to get. So ready to help America get back to some kind of normal.
1/1	I am ready for the vaccine. The owner at my work just told us he will give us a paid week off once we all get vaccinated, I love that he is convincing people by way of incentive
1/1	I am ready for this to be over too, I'm ready for people to stop dying, I'm ready for my parents to be able to hug and kiss their grand children. I'm ready for the world to be safe again.

0/0	I am sceptical to the vaccine when it hasn't been tested for a long time
0/0	I am selflessly refusing a vaccine to make sure a person of color gets it before my privileged self. After all, we don't know all of the effects.
1/1	I am seriously hoping this vaccine works, is safe, and can be mass produced as fast as possible for the sake of the entire world. Really rooting for this ‚Äî and all the other ‚Äî teams.
1/-1	I am shocked but not surprised there are anti-Vaxers in the Valley telling people the COVID vaccine will alter their genetic makeup and make them sick. That‚Äôs no good, friends.
0/0	I am shocked that you would get it. Do they know the long term effects of it? 5 years? 10 years? They have only been working on a vaccine for not even a year. It is quite disturbing that they pushed it out so fast.
1/1	I am sitting in observation as I write this, just got my vaccine a few minutes ago. It feels so surreal, honestly I've been holding back tears since getting my approval yesterday. I can't even imagine yet what the relief will feel like in three weeks. I hope everyone will get this opportunity soon, I know I am very lucky and privileged.

1/1	I am so glad we have Dr. Fauci. A man of reason.
1/1	I am so happy for this vaccine
1/1	I am so happy you have had your shot. I have coworkers who have had it twice now, and others who know people who have had it twice. Even if you have had covid it is still worth it to get the vaccine, it will still have good coverage of new strains that will develop.

0/0	I am vaccine hesitant and nothing they have said has changed my mind. I am still not getting the vaccine. I refuse until I see the long term effects and it seems like the flu shot that you have to get it yearly and I don‚Äôt get the flu shot because I always get the flu when I do and i already had Covid.
1/1	I am vaccine shy (allergic to a lot of things), just got my second covid shot & happy to say I‚Äôm still here! Wasn‚Äôt even abducted by aliens or another adverse reaction.

1/1	I am very proud to say that I was part of this Novavax during the vaccine trial as one of the unblinded nurses who gave the injections to the trial participants. So happy to hear about its outcome.
0/0	I am very reluctant to have this vaccine, but will just see what happens to everyone else, in a few months time?. my elderly neighbour had a bad reaction to the first one!.. he hasn't had the second one yet.

1/0	I am willing to take a 98+% chance of surviving Covid‚Ä¶ :)
0/1	I am worried enough not to want to be at the head of the line for a new vaccine
1/1	I am yet to hear a single logical reason which convinces me that people who refuse to take the vaccine aren't complete nutjobs
0/0	I am, however, saying until a large amount of those people get the vaccine and we have seen how it impacts them, I‚Äôm not getting it. Unless in the next few months research shows that covid itself actively negatively impacts fertility, then I would consider the vaccine. But I would still want to see the research and have some kind of FDA guarantee that it‚Äôs safe for women trying to have children
0/-1	I and many others are transplant patients with immunodepressing drugs against rejection
0/0	I and many would rather die than take this poison

0/0	I appreciate what you do being a part of the healthcare field . But I will not be getting a vaccine. Not now not ever !
1/1/-1	I ask what is worrying them about it. Then try to gently walk through what we know about the concern & how it compares to COVID. I remind them that vax will help us reclaim what we value, protect vulnerable in our lives.
1/-1	I asked a doctor when they think this virus will end. He said how should I know, I'm a doctor not a politician.
1/1	I assume none of you got it and just use this post to feel better about not getting it. I still wear 2 masks at the hospital but getting the vaccine is a step in the right direction even if it‚Äôs only 95% effective in the laboratory. Trying to not get myocarditis.

1/-1	I came here to understand the vaccine and Ted Animation Explain Video is Awesome
1/1	I can even see less getting vaccinated here. It's not even that they're afraid that it's safe. A lot of it is pure apathy and ignorance.
0/0	I can feel mandatory vaccines are not okay, I can decide I don‚Äôt want one, I can think there is a possibility there will be something in them that makes it easy to track that you have gotten it AND not believe this is not the mark of the beast.

1/1	I cannot WAIT for that data about transmission. A lot of the people I speak to who say they won't get it say it's (partially) because "it's only protecting ME. It'd be different if it protected other people." Ok sure. I'll wait. Will love to hear the next excuse after "it's not selfless enough."

1/1	I commend these scientists working on the vaccine, they wait their whole lives for a chance like this. To put everything they learned in school and apply it to the real world, and help save alot of people.
1/1	I consider myself lucky and blessed , not only because I get to have this vaccine early but because I am still COVID free.
0/0	I couldn't agree more. I am not taking it. I don't take vaccines at all.
0/0	I couldn't care less what the flogs say..... I'M NOT GETTING IT, END OF STORY
1/1	I couldn't even watch this, because the anti-vax comments were so typically idiotic it hurt.
1/1	I currently got the vaccine yesterday....I am still alive, and haven't grown a beard or third leg....so after what I have seen and witnessed over the last few months...didnt think twice.
1/1	I definitely am! I trust the scientists
1/1	I definitely recommend us to take this vacine.
0	I definitely won't be vaccinated. Thank you.
0/0	I definitely won't get it
1/1	I did it finally! #CovidVaccine
1/-1	I didn't have any symptoms at the time but took a COVID PCR test anyway. The result¬†was¬†negative.
1/1	I didn't want to go through that again so I had both doses of the Pfizer vaccine.
1/1	I didn‚Äôt feel the needle go in when I got it
0/0	I do NOT plan on taking these EXPERIMENTAL vaccinations! Even now they have to trace you for two years after taking them because the "researchers" do not know what to expect.
0/0	I do agree with that! I won‚Äôt be giving it to my son until they do more trials on kids specifically either.
0/0	I do believe this was rushed. I‚Äôm reasonably healthy
0/0	I do not blame them for not wanting to take the COVID-19 vaccine because it is rushed way too quickly and it has not been tested very long in clinical trials.
1/1	I do not care, In will get this COVID-19 vaccine. No matter what happens!
0/0	I do not consider vaccines for myself unless the disease is Really serious & not from an obvious nutrient deficiency.
0/0	I do not do the mark of the beast. I'm OK without. Jesus has got my back.
0/-1	I do not need the Corona vaccine. I just need to listen to music every day to boost my immunity because it is better and better vaccination.
0/0	I do not trust the vaccine. It takes 5 years to test vaccine. We all get different meds
0/0	I do not trust this vaccine.
0/0	I do not want a chemical (vaccine) messing with my immune system. I'll boost my system naturally thank you
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I do not want that shot.
1/1	I do not want to spreading the COVID-19 virus to others
0/0	I do not want to take it.
1/1	I do plan on getting the vaccine, yes. But this is based on a ‚Äúcost-benefit‚Äù analysis rather than a gut reaction like, get all vaccines!!!!! I am a very healthy, 30-year-old man. The vaccine has reportedly to have some really bad side effects for some people. Even if I get the worst of these, I will be okay because I have no other health problems.
0/0	I do pray they STAY VOLUNTARY!!! I have absolutely NO DESIRE to put that poison into my body, I don‚Äôt care who makes it! I‚Äôm not a sheep and will never be tested on....ever!!! With sooo many natural supplements that WILL prevent C19 and that are far more effective, why would anyone take this risk?!
1/1	I do, millions get vaccinated
0/0	I don't believe 1 word from the who
0/0	I don't believe a word from anyone associated with WHO/ Gates foundation!!!
0/0	I don't believe in this vaccine
0/0	I don't believe there is any future for anybody that takes your gmo vaccines...at least not any bright future...people should be smart and avoid it at any cost‚Ä¶
0/0	I don't blame them because I will not take it anytime soon. To many unknowns, variants popping up to fast, side effects, not studied long enough.
1/1	I don't care about political propaganda, I just want to know which vaccine is safe and easy to get. I know that Pfizer has caused 23 deaths in Norway, what about other vaccine?
1/1	I don't care how authoritarian this sounds. Vaccinations need to be mandatory.
0/0	I don't even get the flu vaccine. Haven't had the flu in 7 years.
0/0	I don't feel like I need it, im 27 and perfectly healthy. Old and weak people can get it first
0/0	I don't get flu vaccines so won't be getting this one.
0/0	I don't give a fuck what they say, I ain't getting the vaccine.
1/1	I don't have any more worries and will take it.
0/0	I don't have the flu vaccine, why would I have this?
1/1	I don't know about the vaccine thing but I hope to get it just to feel better
0/0	I don't know anyone who is excited about vaccine roll-out..
0/0	I don't know anyone who is excited about vaccine roll-out.. not gonna take this
1/1	I don't know how we can get it through people's heads, but the arguments against getting vaccinated, such as "I'm healthy, "I'm young," "I don't have underlying conditions," and so on, are ignorant and selfish. We are at war with this virus, and until we have herd immunity, it's going to keep spreading and mutating into more lethal variants. Can you imagine that if during World War 2, a significant percentage of the draft-eligible population refused to fight? We would have lost the war. The same goes for this war against the virus. This is not the time to whine about personal freedoms and choice. We should all do our part and get vaccinated when our turn comes. Let's inject a little more personal responsibility and civic duty into the narrative.
1/1	I don't know why this is so hard to understand for them. One person being vaccinated works for that person, but it doesn't do anything in the grand scheme of things. For vaccines to work on a large scale, as many people as possible need to be vaccinated. If only one person had been vaccinated for smallpox, that would've done absolutely nothing for humanity as a whole.
1/0	I don't know why, because obviously any death is still a terrible death, but the healthcare worker deaths from covid now seems somehow worse, because they would have been so close to getting their vaccine
0/0	I don't known if ( WHO) want to reduce the world population.with the covid vaccination program people are dying every day .
0/0	I don't like the vaccine, because it is experimental
0/0/0	I don't need a vaccine for the chinese virus
0/0	I don't need a vaccine. I'm am not in a high risk group. I have a very small chance of catching this, and a very small chance of getting really sick if I do. Protect the old and weak and let the rest of us get on with keeping the economy alive.
0/0	I don't need a vaccine. Since what you giving people is not really a vaccine.
0/0	I don't need any vaccine coz am okay since starting this pandemic coz my immune system is very strong no any virus can come to me and I believe on Jesus Christ that he will save me and even my death bcome so near then I don't wrry I will die in the name of God
0/0	I don't need or want the vaccine so...where does that leave me? Doomed to never travel abroad again? Coercive bullshit
0/0	I don't really trust the current vaccine, the company making them has a bad rep because their vaccines had side effect that showed up years later
1/-1	I don't see the step where the microchip is transferred by Bill gates.
0/0	I don't take flu shot I'm probably not gonna take this rushed vaccine
0/0	I don't take the vaccine.. I go for canabis lol.. Vaccine Is nothing... Those taking vaccine still die..
0/0	I don't take vaccines because I believe natural is best.
1/1	I don't think I've ever been this excited or even looked forward to geting a vaccine. Shoot me the fuck up.
0/0	I don't think the Vaccine will solve anything. People are so scared because of the media. During the war the Media were not allowed to scare people. I refuse to live in fear and take my vitamins and minerals
1/1	I don't think vaccination should be mandatory for the population at-large, but for people who work with the elderly and immunocompromised? Yeah, it's only a matter of time before it's made mandatory.
1/1	I don't think vaccines are bad but I do think people should have a choice whether to take them or not if they want to experience the virus or not is up to them
0/0	I don't trust a vaccine when the manufacturer isn't accountable for its effects.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I don't trust a vaccine when the manufacturer isn't accountable for its effects. Idc how much you lie.
0/0	I don't trust in BIG PHARMA
0/0	I don't trust it and I advise everyone not to vaccinate
0/0	I don't trust none of them at all
0/0	I don't trust none of these people I won't be getting it neither will my daughters.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I don't trust none of these people I won't be getting it neither will my daughters.. Period
0/0	I don't trust that PCR swab test either - and I don't care what anyone thinks about me I ain't taking any of it.
0/0	I don't trust these "vaccines".
0/0	I don't trust vaccines it doesn't make better..
1/1	I don't understand how no vax can exist
0/-1	I don't understand why places can make it mandatory when it isn't known yet if the vaccine prevents spread.
0/0	I don't vaccinate my 6 kids and their perfectly fine!
0/1/0	I don't vaccinate my kids because I don't feel safe jamming a needle in my kids arm. I'd rather have a professional do it
1/1	I don't vaccinate my kids. I believe its harmful to them and could lead to complications. I let my doctor do it, he's done it and studied how to for years.
1/-1	I don't wanna risk my kid getting arthritis or something so I'll let them die of a 15th century steamship disease instead
0/0	I don't want a rushed vaccine
1/-1	I don't want an anti-vaxers child in my school
0/0	I don't want it. and you can't force it if I am free and no I don't trust no one.
0	I don't want kids. Gimme that vaccine now.
1/0	I don't want my kids to live in this madness, staying always at home doing nothing. What the hell!!!
0/0	I don't want no nanotechnology in my body.
0/-1	I don't want that !!! I think is not enough time to make sure r not side effects.
0/0	I don't want that crap in my body I'm a natural herbalist I don't need poison
0/0	I don't want the vaccine
0/-1	I don't want to be first in line, will wait a few months so you know more about the sideeffects
0/0	I don't want to be vaccinated. Please respect that. My body, my choice.
1/-1	I don't want to die, I have no choice
1/1	I don't want to get COVID!
0/0	I don't want to get vaccinated. I would prefer to take the distance measurements than losing my life after this vaccine.
0/0	I don't want to live in a world of cowards, snitches, vaccine obsessives and people who believe giving up basic human freedoms for elimination of risks is a good bargain. It's a subhuman, pathetic way to live. That's not what God made us for!
1/1	I don't want to loose my grand mother. She is the only person that cares for me! I will do it for her
0/0	I don't want to take the vaccine because I want to experiment with the natural stuff first that seems more promising.
0/0/0/0/0	I don't want to take the vaccine in case it turns me into a lizard
0/0	I don't want to take this vaccine which can potentially transform me into a mutant zombie.
0/0	I dont believe it...
0/0	I dont buy new cars because they have kinks that make them get recalls; injecting something new in me??....I'm good...
1/1	I dont care about side effects, I will take it ASAP.
0/0	I dont care how many kinds of vaccines are. I will NOT take one. üòå
1/1	I dont care if you support Boris or Not but you should APPRECIATE his efforts to vaccinate UK citizens
0/0	I dont have any questions, I'm not getting it, nor are the majority of Australia.
0/0	I dont know a single person who is willing to take it
0/0	I dont make the vaccine thank you
0/0	I dont take the flu shot and hardly ever get the flu. I got covid this year and didnt have ONE symptom. Keep your vaccine, I will pass.
0	I dont trust it.....Lets see how many die in the 70+ age group first before we have it
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I dont trust that vaccination at all.
0/0	I dont trust that vaccination at all. They dint even test it on animals
0/0	I dont trust this
0/0	I dont trust this devils‚Ä¶
0/0	I dont trust vaccines rushed, people will die regardless of what it offers.
1/1	I dont understand all the hatred for the vaccinnes from these weirdly suspicious people‚Ä¶ do you want the pandemic to end or not????
0/0	I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want my DNA altered, thanks
1/1	I don‚Äòt understand the anti-vaxxer movement, I‚Äòm going to get vaccinated as soon as possible.
0/1	I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm taking the vaccine.
1/1	I don‚Äôt care about ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù so long as I‚Äôm protected against COVID. If others want to reject vaccination, they can please themselves. I‚Äôll be getting vaccinated.
1/-1	I don‚Äôt care, gimme gimme gimme!
0/0	I don‚Äôt disagree with you. I just think that we‚Äôd save more lives by not forcing vaccinations and focusing on education, community support, fostering trust and I think forcing even hospital staff to get the vaccine could jeopardize that.
0	I don‚Äôt feel guilty waiting, since so many people are so eager to get it, I‚Äôll wait, no hurry, thank you. Lemme know how it goes.
0/0	I don‚Äôt feel guilty waiting, since so many people are so eager to get it, I‚Äôll wait, no hurry, thank you. Lemme know how it goes. I‚Äôve heard Bell‚Äôs palsy is possible side effect.
1/1	I don‚Äôt find this shocking at all. This should be universally accepted. There is no excuse to not get vaccinated unless you have some rare health condition which exempts you. We need to stop letting these a holes from bringing back polio or covid just because they don‚Äôt wanna get vaccinated
1/1	I don‚Äôt get flu shots never have. I will get covid vaccine since it does not require annual shots.
1/1	I don‚Äôt know also about it. But I got first dose of Covid vaccinated today. And so far I am still feeling better. We appeal you all please get vaccinated without fear. Thank you.
0/0	I don‚Äôt know for I‚Äôm not taking the vaccine
0/0	I don‚Äôt like the two month threshold for the long term outcome effects. Doesn‚Äôt seem right.
0/0/0	I don‚Äôt mind to be the last person on earth to take the vaccine
0/0	I don‚Äôt need any vaccine I know how to heal from holistic and natural medicine you will never know the side effects
0/0	I don‚Äôt plan on getting the vaccine for COVID.
0/0	I don‚Äôt plan on taking it because I just never take medicine or get the flu shot.
1/1	I don‚Äôt really mind which vaccine I get, it‚Äôs all going in the right direction!
0/0	I don‚Äôt think Ill be taking the vaccine.
1/1	I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get mine for a long time because I don‚Äôt fit any of the categories but I will definitely get it when it‚Äôs offered to me
0/0	I don‚Äôt think so.I follow a natural diet regimen where I eat only natural foods as found in nature, with a modest amount of high-quality proteins, supplemented with fermented vegetables and superpowder drink mixes. I live an energetic life style. I stopped taking the annual flu shots years ago and have not had the flu or even the sniffles in the last 6 years.
0/-1	I don‚Äôt think the hesitancy has anything to do with the side effects. It seems to be the quick turnaround of labeling this so-called vaccine with an over 90% success rate when it has been produced in less than a year of the first reported case of the virus
0/0	I don‚Äôt think we will even need a vaccine to end this pandemic
0/0	I don‚Äôt trust a rushed vaccine. I got all my shots even flu shots but I don‚Äôt plan on getting the covid vaccine till at least 3 months after it comes available and I see how it goes.
0/0	I don‚Äôt trust any kind of medication or vaccine that has been developed in less than a year and no trail testing? What kind of reaction to this in say 3 months 6 months, a year ? Nope I‚Äôll wait!
0/0	I don‚Äôt trust any vaccine that was created in less than a year, especially at the insistence of the Trump administration. I do mask and practice social distancing and have been quarantined, even working from home. So I‚Äôm not ignorant of the disease or it‚Äôs effects. I just trust NOTHING that Trump had his hand in, knowing what a corrupt person he is.
0/0/0/0	I don‚Äôt trust drs anymore, especially those at the CDC
0/0	I don‚Äôt trust nothing until it is proven to work
0/0	I don‚Äôt trust this vaccine
1/1	I don‚Äôt understand. Why would anyone (unless advised not to by a doctor) NOT get a vaccine?
0/0	I don‚Äôt vaccinate my children because I let nature do it‚Äôs thing
1/1	I don‚Äôt want anybody to die or get sick but I anticipate a tipping point where most people who have been taking this seriously are vaccinated, and the majority of new sick and dead are those who have been reckless the whole time. At least then the ones being idiotic are the ones paying the price.
0/0	I don‚Äôt want it and some my colleagues too
0/0	I don‚Äôt want my DNA altered, thanks
0/0	I don‚Äôt want this thing near me. I‚Äôm hearing employers can do forced vaccinations too that would be ridiculous. I can‚Äôt believe what‚Äôs going on
1/1	I don‚Äôt want to say miracle, as seems to devalue the science, but the fact we are about to have two highly effective vaccines to choose from is amazing. I hope the scientists who developed these vaccines go down in history and are never forgotten.
0/0	I don‚Äôt want to take the Vaccine. I have the right to refuse
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I don‚Äôt want to take the Vaccine. I have the right to refuse!!!
1/-1	I drink diet coke so‚Ä¶shoot me up too. Stay safe everyone!
0/0	I ended up in the ER after my first vaccine. The symptoms slowly continued to mount up until I couldn't move and was unresponsive.I had to go by ambulance. I really don't think the ER knew how to react. After I started to come around after 12 hours and some sort of treatment, the doctor said he believes it was a reaction from the injection. Still waiting to feel back to speed
1/1	I feel great and looking forward to the second dose of covid vaccine!
1/1	I feel like the people that say vaccines work, but choose to not get them are even more insane than people who think vaccines don‚Äôt work at all. Even if the chances are 1/3000 or something similar, the comfort of myself is less important than the lives of the vulnerable (immuno-compromised). This goes along with masks with COVID-19. Even if there was an extremely small chance of it to prevent the spread, I would value that small chance to save a life over my comfort. I personally believe that people who go against this philosophy are morally bad people.
1/-1	I feel like the vaccine gonna slowly pick us off one by one over time so it seems normal
1/1	I feel like this video should be on the evening news everyday to reduce fears of the vaccine and educate the public.
0/0	I feel sad for anybody who gets the ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù ü§£ü§£ü§£ they putting the disease into u
1/1	I feel sad for people who lacks knowledge about biology lmao. They ain‚Äôt putting diseases in you (lol) they are putting weakened forms of virus and sometimes parts of the virus hull with the glycoprotein so that there will be a proper immune response to produce the antibodies for the virus. Shut up, your lack of intellect is appalling...
1/1	I feel safer knowing that I‚Äôve gotten both vaccinations. But we‚Äôre not yet out of the woods; there is a long way to go before we can expect to return to pre-pandemic life ‚Äî or some of it, at least.
1/1	I feel so blessed that our community has access to the vaccine & that with each shot given we are able to further protect ourselves and our loved ones.
1/1	I feel so lucky to work in a district that is making vaccinations readily available to teachers and staff! Vaccine 1 done!
1/1	I feel very fortunate that i received my first shot last week. Its been a hard year wondering if the next patient you interact with might have Covid. A good year of wearing an N95 for 10 hours a day, pay reductions and a 6 month partial furlough. At least once a day a patient I have dealt with is positive that either wasn't wearing a mask or was not thought to have Covid (asymptomatic). It was a significant/emotional/happy moment that I know many of my fellow co-workers experienced this week when we got that first jab.
1/1	I feel you. Very excited to get vaccinated as soon as I can. We‚Äôve survived this for a year now, I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll get through a few more months
1/1/1	I feel you. Very excited to get vaccinated as soon as I can. We‚Äôve survived this for a year now, I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll get through a few more months :)
1/1	I felt confident that doing so was the right choice, getting the vaccine.
1/1	I felt faint after my first dose yesterday. But ok after a nights sleep.
1/-1	I felt like I learned so much, and cleared up a lot of confusion. Also, the immunology animations were amazing!
1/1	I felt pretty rough but took it as a positive sign that my body was fighting back. I‚Äôd rather feel ill than die, or risk passing it onto someone else who dies. I‚Äôd quite like to get out and about a bit without having to worry about that.
1/1	I finally had my vaccine this morning! A great system and lovely staff members and volunteers
1/1	I finally had my vaccine this morning! A great system and lovely staff members and volunteers down at Redwood Education Centre
1/1	I finally was able to schedule a covid 19 vaccination for this Thursday.
0/0	I find it interesting that Baseball Legend Hank Aaron died more than 2 weeks after taking the Coronavirus vaccine. #NoVaccineforme
0/0	I find it interesting that people don't give you a hard time about being skeptical about a new drug on the market, but vaccines are somehow completely safe and shouldn't even be questioned. I mean the exact same drug companies that kill hundreds of thousands with prescription drugs are also producing the holy vaccines. This is all common knowledge!
0/0	I find it odd there are no videos of anyone talking about there bad experience...true or untrue???thinking there being blocked
1/1	I find it quite sad when patients give their reasoning as to why they are not getting the vaccine, I hear it everyday. Suddenly everyone is an expert like they‚Äôve studied the virus for years. I will trust the experts who have dedicated their whole life in the field.
1/1	I find it strange how little trust there is in research that has had virtually unlimited funding and support worldwide.
0/0	I find it very amusing at the fact in every picture of health care workers getting vaccinated, we do not see the actual needle nor it going in. It has been revealed on numerous occasions, with the exact same discrepancies as this example. Propaganda at its finest. all you want with those paid smiles, but you cannot deny nor hide the truth
1/1	I find that people who doubt vaccines have no historical knowledge of just how devastating disease has been to humanity throughout the centuries.
1/1	I follow a lot of doctors on Twitter they have already gotten their second dose said they had more side effects but nothing major, they said they felt like they do after a flu shot. This was from the Pfizer vaccine. Still can't wait to get mine
0/0	I for one will not be taking it. I can't trust this scam. I will wait to see what happens to everyone that took one.
0/1	I forgot to add that the vaccine is today the best way to spread the Covid
1/0	I found an anti vax shirt for kids, and I wondered if there were any in adult sizes, but I realized it would be pointless
0/0	I found myself an integrative doctor. She is fantastic! She even said the Covid vaccine is bad and she wouldn‚Äôt be giving it.
0/-1	I gave you a like for your positive efforts and your scientific showmanship....other then that, I‚Äôm not taking that shit.
1/1	I get asked this question a lot. The vaccine helps our bodies develop immunity without having to be sick with the virus
1/1	I get my 1st Covid vaccination tomorrow. I am actually looking forward to it!
1/1	I get my 2nd dose Monday. I‚Äôm nervous and ready‚ô•Ô∏èü§ç‚ô•Ô∏èü§ç
1/1	I get my 2nd dose on Thursday this week (Feb 4) and I'm just trying to get STOKED for it and mentally prepared
1/1	I get my second dose tomorrow! I believe and trust the science and I feel so lucky that I was even able to get it! I‚Äôm in healthcare and I have high risk family members, so it brings me peace of mind
0/0	I get that they want to calm the public and all, but the way I see it, I know what to expect if I get Corona virus: two weeks of suffering that I'll live through. What I DON'T know are the long-term effects of this rushed to market vaccine. No ty, I'll pass.
1/1	I get vaccinated not just for myself but for those who can't get vaccinated
0/-1	I give my dose to the World Health Organization
1/1	I go Saturday for my 1st shot of Moderna. I was glad to hear this. I'm a little nervous but we need to defeat his virus!!
0	I got Covid ; my relatives and friends70; 80; 60 50 years old with diabetics obese high pressure survived by healing at home just herbal teas and honey. We all eat mostly natural food home cooked or years. We walk 1 h a day Go natural!! Simplify your life .
1/1	I got Pfizer with no reaction. Scheduled for 2nd shot.
1/1	I got a really bad fear of needles but I STILL go donate blood (yes I have a PA every time but I donating saves lives so..) and will get the vaccine
1/1	I got both my shots because I work in a hospital and I'm perfectly fine. Don't be frightened. Trust in science. Thank you President Biden!
1/1	I got both of my doses and my parents are gettkng their first one vaccine. The year is going in the right direction
0/0	I got covid and I know lots of people who got it. It wasn't bad. Flu is worst. Won't taking any vaccines. Good health is the best protection no vaccines can beat it.
1/0	I got it on Monday. Now I'm dead.
1/1	I got it today, I'm very hopeful this is the best vaccine so far
1/1	I got mine (Pfizer) last Wednesday. No sore arm or side effects. I expect the 2nd one will include side effects.
1/-1	I got mine (Pfizer). Went to work like normal afterwards. Just hung out in bed all day the following day, felt no worse than had I gone to the gym. Dose 1 my arm was immediately sore, but I didn't even feel dose 2 until the constitutional symptoms began. By day 3 after the 2nd dose, I was perfect. If you're lucky enough to have the vaccine available, GET IT!
0/-1	I got mine yesterday My arm hurts and I feel like I have the flu.
1/1	I got mine yesterday just a bit of cold & sore arm but I'm glad i got it
1/1	I got my #CovidVaccine ..Get yourself vaccinated..We can end this together, insha'allah. #VaccinesWork #togetherwecan #CovidEndgame
1/1	I got my #CovidVaccine today. I did it for all the expectant moms that I‚Äôm around while helping them install their #carseats.
1/1	I got my 1st jab today,with sinopharm vax.I can say that it goes pretty well without having pain the moment doctor inserted the needle,a little bit numbness after few hours and that's normal side effects of any vaccine...
1/-1	I got my 2nd Moderna shot yesterday. I have taken the day off of work and have been in bed all day with extreme body aches, headaches and fatigue. I experienced the same symptoms from the first shot
1/1	I got my 2nd covid vaccine dose 2 days ago. I got chest pain & sharp lung pain the following day. Have had body pain, mainly lower pack pain since. No fever no chills. A lot of body soreness and currently a sore throat. Hopefully this is it and nothing worse comes.
1/1	I got my Covid vaccination this morning. Such a sense of relief and gratitude to the NHS and scientists who made it happen.
0/1	I got my Covid vaccine today. Yay! But RIP my arm, which will henceforth be referred to as the ‚Äúpain log.‚Äù
0/0/1	I got my MMR Vaccine yesterday. Today I woke up dead. Coincidence? I think not.
1/1	I got my Pfizer vaccine today. I‚Äôm trusting the science.
1/1	I got my both of my shots in September and October as part of the Moderna trial. I had a sore arm after the first and then after the second I had a fever the day after and fatigue. 100% worth it.
1/1	I got my first Pfizer vaccine in California, and will get my second shot on Thursday. Better cellulite than six feet under and suffering by myself waiting to dye alone.
1/1	I got my first covid-19 vaccine today, and like all ‚Äúlate to the party‚Äù instances in my life, I‚Äôm alone in my excitement.
1	I got my first does 5 minutes ago. Thank you!!
1/1/1	I got my first dose and now i am waiting for the second one.
1/1	I got my first dose of Moderna yesterday . No side effects
1/1	I got my first dose of covishield today. However, I will still wear a mask, wash my hands, maintain distancing and be a responsible citizen. Together we can curb the spread of this brutal disease.
1/1	I got my first dose of the vaccine today! It feels so good to be headed toward the other side of this pandemic. If and when you are able, get your shot!
1/1	I got my first dose this week, felt so good for so many reasons!
1/1	I got my first dose today too! My arm is unbelievable sore! I‚Äôve been over the moon all day.
1/1	I got my first dose too also waiting for the second one but am very ok
1/1	I got my first flu shot last October. I will get the covid vaccine in the future.
1/1	I got my first shot ALREADY, just a sore arm. It's too new is the reason. You understand all vaccines are new at one point right!? Don't get the polio vaccine either, have fun with THAT
1/1	I got my first shot DEC 23. Saturday my coworker tested positive, my boss test positive Tuesday and my other coworker test positive Thursday. I tested negative Wednesday! I think it works and we should push as much to have it.
1/1	I got my first shot today (Pfizer). I am a doctor and work in long term care homes so I was higher on the priority lists where I live and work. Other than soreness in the arm, no side effects. Feeling very relieved and hopeful.
1/1	I got my first vaccine shot yesterday. I will get the second dose in February! So happy I got it!
1	I got my fist vaccine shot yesterday. Was in and out, no problem. Only a sore arm this morning. I‚Äôm good with that. I would much rather be sick from the shot for a couple of days, than in a hospital with COVID for weeks.
1/1	I got my moderna vaccine today!
1/1	I got my second dose Friday and am 9 weeks pregnant. Without question the best decision for me. I know it is minimal, but I do want first trimester mamas to know that pregnancy fatigue + vaccine fatigue is absolutely incapacitating for about 2 days. It is worth knowing so you can prepare.
1/1	I got my second dose four days ago in the Cayman Islands. I am 60 years old. Other than a slight discomfort on my deltoid the second day I had absolutely zero side effect from the first or second dose. Few people I spoke way around my age claimed weakness for a few days, slight headaches and obvious but tolerable pain on their shoulder after vaccination. I also spoke with a few people who were cancer survivors with no threatening side effects after vaccination. We have vaccinated over 20.000 people here in Cayman and there has not been any threatening situations whatsoever.
1/1	I got my second dose today. I‚Äôm relieved

1/1/1/1	I got my vaccine 2 days ago!!!
1/1	I got my vaccine this past Friday. It went really well!
1/1	I got my vaccine today!!!
1/1	I got my vaccine today. Loads of side effects... ...I have a strange feeling of optimism, an overwhelming sense of relief and my mouth seems to want to turn upwards on both sides.
0/0	I got my vaccine. It‚Äôs a blend of various whiskeys from Scotland.
0/-1	I got side effects from watching a bit of this. Found the cure. Bye !
1/1	I got the 1st of the two doses so far. Grateful.
1/1	I got the COVID vaccine. I had some side effects, which included fevers, chills, muscle aches, and a headache. It went away after Tylenol. It is important to note that you should take Tylenol after the vaccine and not before, as this may interfere with the immune response. The COVID vaccine is safe and effective.
0/0	I got the Covid 19 vaccine last month and it has me feeling terribly ill and I haven't felt normal since the 5th day after the 1st shot then I got my 2nd shot last Friday it's now monday and I fear I made a mistake getting vaccinated.I vehemently advise everyone DO NOT take this vaccine!!
1/1/1/1/1/1	I got the Covid-19 vaccine today.
1/1	I got the Moderna shot. It's been ok so far
1/1	I got the Moderna yesterday. No issues. Grateful to be vaccinated.
1/1	I got the Pfizer vacinne yesterday. The only side effect, my arm is a little sore. I slept good last night. Excited to get started. This is how we are going to beat Covid.. Vaccine, mask and social distancing!! Everyone should be on board!! We can do this!!
1/1	I got the Vaccine and this is the only thing that has put me at peace. Thank you!
1/1	I got the covid vaccine and a tattoo on the same day so if people are really concerned about bad side effects just know that I am perfectly fine and I doubt you will be getting both a tat and a vaccine on the same day so it‚Äôs safe to be vaccinated!!!
0/1	I got the covid vaccine yesterday (hype!) but now my arm super sore,They said any side effect should only last a day or two so I hope that‚Äôs the case!
1/1	I got the dose 1 of the Covid19 vaccine just now! #CovidVaccine
1/1	I got the first dose, I have sore arm, slight fever and chills but I know the benefits outweigh the pain. I don`t know if the scientists read this but please stop torturing those poor animals in the lab by injecting them with this painful vaccin, sticking a swab in their nose to see if they have covid! I know as a human is gonna do me good but animals don`t know, for them is torture. Aren`t we humans cruel, to save our species we inflict so much pain to others :( I just want to say a big thank you to all those poor lab animals and hopefully they didn`t die in vain and this vaccine will work and they are done with testing more trials on animals.
1/1	I got the first shot of the vaccine guys !
1/1	I got the flu shot today and cannot wait for the covid vaccination. Thank you so much for this vid! Take care, stay safe, and have a happy new year! With lots of love:)
1/1	I got the flu shot. I‚Äôm still alive. How is this any different? I‚Äôll take the vaccine.
1/1	I got the moderna shot about 10 days ago and have been doing fine since thankfully!
1/1	I got the moderna vaccine and i have pre existing medical conditions i remember i had to wait in line for 2 hours to get vaccinated. Once I got in I tried to explain to this lady about my hormonal disorder. She didn't understand, so then i said that I also have asthma and then she said well why didn't you just say that!! So then I went to another station and they told me that I would be getting the moderna vaccine. Then after I got the vaccine they had everyone wait outside for 15 minutes in case of an allergic reaction. I went home and started feeling weird I got aches and pain a over I got a headache. Next day woke up with a headache and sweating a lot. After just pain in my arm and swelling because I have a crapy immune system. If you have a good immune system you'll be fine. My mother got it the same day as me and she felt nothing
1/1	I got the pfizer vaccine 8 days ago. Im feeling abit down but nothing else tho.
1/1	I got the pfizer!
1/0	I got the vaccine I had a mild headache sore injection sight (mild) like someone punching you in the arm during the game "slug bug" lol I got a back ache (mild to medium depending on your pain tolerance) my girlfriend got the same symptoms we are smokers idk if that causes anything different... I feel so much safer now tho I recommend it all the residents at my group home were vaccinated today as well it was 2 weeks to late though a cook who didn't wear her mask properly every ( with chronic allergies was infected and spread it to 19/20 residents 70 and up.... 4 of which passed away in one week from covid at its worst 15 of the 20 residents went to the hospital for 2+ days or so defending. I say all this because if your scared of the vaccine do it for someone you care about and not for yourself because covid and mask if no big deal UNTIL one person doesn't follow the protocols and now u have a a wildfire spread throughout your work or family home. I was scared at to get vaccinated but I had to be the first at my job to show othersThat its safe.
0/1/1	I got the vaccine and felt tired for a few days. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s been a week and I feel fine.
1/1	I got the vaccine and nothing happened to me.
1/1	I got the vaccine as a front line worker. I'm fine now.
1/0	I got the vaccine as a front line worker. Initially it didn't hurt but the 2nd day to 4th day my arm was sore but nothing intolerable. However I did suffer from extreme fatigue and irritability the 2nd and 3rd day
1/1	I got the vaccine for Covicild on January 28. I have no problem. I request you guys that you too should get a vaccine when you get the opportunity.
1/1	I got the vaccine too and shared my journey, on my yt just now!!
1/1	I got the vaccine two days ago... I'm fine. I felt like I was getting a cold for about an hour. It takes me longer to recover from a Flu shot. My arm hurt for about 24 hours. That's it....
1/1	I got the vaccine, moderna one, and I was just very sleepy lol
1/1	I got the vaccine... no issues lol
0/0	I got thru 2020 without getting covid so ill be fine without the dumb vaccine

1/1	I got vaccinated for my loved ones
1/1/1	I got vaccinated with first dose 2 weeks ago and i feel great without side affects
0/0	I got vaccinated yesterday and I feel terrible
0/0	I guarantee you..... the people who drop dead shortly After taking the Vaccines.... Would Still be Alive & Well if they did NOT take them .
1/1	I guess I‚Äôll be the only one in the comments to say I‚Äôm looking forward to getting my vaccine as soon as we have good evidence of safety from late stage trials.
0/-1	I guess it's called herd immunity when you're considered cattle. üêÆüêÆüêÆüêÆ
1/1	I had 2 doses of Pfizer, other than arm pain, I had NO side effects
1/1	I had 2 doses of Pfizer, other than arm pain, I had NO side effects.
1/1	I had AstraZeneca's vaccine in a trial. The side effects weren't fun after the initial dose. I felt like I had the flu for 2 days. No side effects after the second dose. That said, the side effects were a small price to pay for covid immunity.
1/1	I had COVID, and after a stay in the hospital I am 41 and on oxygen until my lungs heal...when and if I can get it..I will!!!! I absolutely do not want this again!!!!
0/0	I had COVID-19 last month. The side effects for the vaccine sound like they are worse than what I had with the actual virus.
1/1	I had Covid at the beginning of the year. I had my first Pfizer shot Tuesday. I can tell you now that you'd rather have the jab a thousand times over than the real thing!
1/1	I had Covid in December, and had the vaccine in January only side effect I had was my arm was achy from the jab.
0/0	I had a bad reaction to the only flu shot that I got. Even though I am in and out of hospitals all day, I‚Äôm waiting to get vaccinated until more information comes out about it.
0/0	I had a bad reaction to the swine flu vaccine four years ago. We were told it was safe so i wont be taking this vaccine.
1/1	I had a dream last night that I was getting my vaccine. Too bad it was only a dream. I have to wait a lot because I am 34 . So I don‚Äôt know when I will get it .
0/0	I had a flu shot years ago and I have a permanent side effect. So, unless they are 100 percent sure, no vaccine till then!
0/0/0	I had a flu shot years ago and I have a permanent side effect. Tendentious in my right ankle. But never again for me.
0/0	I had a man come to my house yeterday to do some work, and was chatting away, then he said, " will you be having the jab?", i said no, how can you know whats in that then, he just said " well, we dont really know, do we, but yes , i'll be having it", nice bloke, and probobly in his thirties, he told me he was married and had three children, but he has accepted the narrative without question, i said he really ought to do some research into what is going into these vaccines, " oh well," he said and then moved off into another room, and i fear that is the sort of attitude of many, what a great shame.
1/1	I had a nasty experience of covid last year my self and went to get my covid vaccine and yes had a little breakdown emotionally as I stood and said thank you to the lord for showing some light and thank you to all the staff that was actually vaccinating us all one by one
0/-1	I had a professor in med school who said ‚Äú Don‚Äôt ever be the first or the last to try a medication‚Äù. I‚Äôm planning on doing exactly that.
1/1	I had an adverse reaction as a kid and my parents were advised to not continue my vaccination plan. I had 2/3 sets of vaccinations. My reaction was honestly very minor. I had a full body rash that lasted a couple weeks. The doctors were worried about more severe allergic reactions though. That being said, I've realized as an adult that I wish they would have finished them. I have literally met people who had several family members get polio from not being vaccinated. One of the three people in their family died who got it. Yet their entire family is still stingintly anti-vaxx. I literally have to keep my self from screaming what are you doing at them? I'm not a medical professional but have a science background and the amount of disinformation boggles my mind. Did no one ever teach you to vet sources at any point in your life? Apparently not, which is a complete failure of our school system.
1/1	I had both shots and only had very mild fatigue and slightly swollen lymph nodes. Nothing that slowed me down though. Much better than all the patient's I've had who were sick with covid.
1/1	I had chills and fever, aching from head to toe, extreme tiredness and headache, as well as dead arm, generally feeling Absolutely crap. Side effects lasted for 48 hours, so far. Absolutely worth it , better than covid complications any day.
1/1	I had first dose of Pfizer last month and I am absolutely fine. I didn't have any side effects. I am 60 with RRMS. I take Fingolimod
1/1	I had mine about 2 weeks ago. Arm was sore for a few days. Had a headache next day & felt abit off then was fine day after that. Bring on the next 1 xx
1/1	I had mine last Wednesday, I was a little achy and tired the next day ,but that passed within 24 hours and I felt my normal self , my arm a little tender for a couple of days but it‚Äôs worth it in the long term , so please if your offered the vaccine take it .
1/1	I had mine so did my family , it‚Äôs perfectly liget .
1/1	I had my 1st Astra Zeneca jab a couple of weeks ago. I felt really tired and had a heavy / foggy head for about 48 hours- I can only liken it to a hangover or jet lag. But the alternative is much worse isn‚Äôt it? I am so happy and relieved I had it.
1/1	I had my Pfizer vaccine and did not feel any side effects. I believe it works well with me
1/1	I had my Pfizer vaccine and did not feel any side effects. I believe it works well with me ‚Äòalhamdullilah‚Äô
1/1	I had my Pfizer vaccine yesterday and I am 20 years old! I have chronic lung disease, asthma and I was born 13 weeks premature. The only side effect I've had is gratefulness <3 Keep safe everyone!
1	I had my first Moderna shot, they are doing people over 65 along with frontline workers nursing home residents
1/1	I had my first covid vaccine today, one more to go
1/1	I had my first dose of a vaccine (Oxford) today and I am grateful
1/1	I had my first dose of vaccine .. Looking for 2nd dose
1/1	I had my second vaccine yesterday! Had a sore arm and feeling a bit tired today but feeling completely fine other than that
1/1	I had my vaccine a few days ago now and I had a slight headache after and a very sore arm , but within a day back to normal ... just have the bloody vaccine and life can start to rebuild
1/0	I had my vaccine a week ago and now I am feeling morning sickness and nausea.
1/1	I had my vaccine last Thursday! I had a really sore arm on Friday easing on Saturday not even a twinge on Sunday. Rather that than lying at deaths door with Covid 19. Have your vaccination PLEASE!
1/1	I had side-effects. The usual side-effects you get when the antigens in a vaccine have stimulated the body's defence mechanisms. Tired, a bit under the weather for a few hours, very mild headache, etc. Nothing to worry about; in fact the reverse; they are a sign that my body's immune response will be producing antibodies which will be lying in wait for any Covid-19 viruses which dare to try and invade. Side-effects are welcome, as was the vaccine.
1/1	I had some covid vaccine side effects that were very mild. They improved with Tylenol. I don't regret getting the vaccine, since now I am immune to COVID!
1/1	I had the Oxford vaccine, my arm ached for about 2 days and then for about a week after it hurt around the injection site. I carried on working as usual and didn't care much for the side effects as it means that I'm one step closer to being able to hug my grandad, which I haven't been able to do in over a year
1/0	I had the Pfizer vaccine last monday and i still feel terrible
1/1	I had the Pfizer vaccine, apart from an achy arm, I was fine ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç get vaccinated folks, when it is offered to you, take it!
0/1	I had the covid vaccine yesterday and it‚Äôs knocked me out. Been in bed all day and had to call in sick at work. Think I‚Äôve had every side effect since last night
0/1	I had the first dose of the vaccine on Friday & I am fine besides a sore arm were the injection site is like the flu jab
1/1	I had the first ‚Äî and lived. I can hardly wait for the 2nd in 2 weeks.
1/1	I had the flu and pneumonia shots a couple weeks ago. 3 degree fever and major body aches for about 2 days. I've never reacted that hard before to a flu shot before. I would rather be on my ass for 2-3 days with the vaccine than two plus weeks and the possibility of needing a vent.
1/1	I had the jab yesterday. See you on the other side üòÅ
1/1	I had the shingles vaccine. Felt like I‚Äôd been hit by a truck for a few days (achy...I have RA. Maybe that‚Äôs why?). Better than getting shingle though!!
0/0	I had the vaccine 3 days ago, i started to have a really strong cough recently and also i vomited 2 times, also i could not play football as i used befoe cus i kinda feel weakness, tbh i should not have had it. Its almost one week and im not feeling okay
1/0	I had the vaccine 3 days ago, i started to have a really strong cough recently and also i vomited 2 times, also i could not play football as i used befoe cus i kinda feel weakness, tbh i should not have had it. Its almost one week and im not feeling okay, sorry for my bad english, god bless you and bless all your loved ones.
1/1	I had the vaccine yesterday... IM ALIVE ü•≥
1/1	I had this vaccine and I'm just recovering from being what if feels like, being hit by a bus! I told my wife and baby boy, I loved them so much...thinking the worse! But if it gives me a chance to see my boy grow have a future, it was worth the pain!
1/1	I had this vaccine in the trials. Side effects were minor.
1	I had to have this vaccine as I am allergic to penicillin do cannot have the Pfizer. Any vaccine is better than none. Maybe by the time I have my top up it will be improved but whatever I'd had I will continue to observe the basic guidelines for a long time yet.
1/1	I had two doses . Little effects in a few days. Sore arm. I am alive !!! Vaccine is safe !
1/-1	I hate anti vaccers with my whole heart
1/1	I hate anti vaxxers
0/0	I hate science and vaccine
1/1	I hate the SEC you can't just say you have the best vaccine ever but thanks for the tips. Please end this pandemic! :)
0/0	I hate to say it but this is starting to look like natural selection on a vast scale. Thousands of cars formed queues miles long and waited for hours to get vaccinated at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. Hundreds of people tried to hand them leaflets with information about the "vaccine", it's ingredients and it's dangers. The sheep kept their car windows tightly closed. Just like little children sticking their fingers in their ears and yelling "Na-na-na-na". Those pamphlets could have saved their lives.
1/1/0	I hate to tell you this, but everyone being vaccinated will not make Americans normal.
1/1	I hate when people just say "research". What research? When I researched vaccines as a parent I looked at tons of peer reviewed studies and came to the conclusion that the benefits of vaccinating greatly outweighed any risks. I have trouble believing anyone could look at what I did with an open mind and come to any other conclusion. So what "research" are people who are anti-vaccine looking at? Anecdotal evidence is not good evidence!
0/0	I have God, i will not put that poison in my body
1/1	I have a Rammstein concert in September so y'all better get your vaccination.
0/0/0	I have a child with autism and I began to see a change im my son just hours after his MMR vaccine. This documentary holds absolute truth on this government/vaccine conspiracy
0/0/0	I have a friend who has a child that got autistic after a vaccine.
1	I have a good feeling that over the next few months we'll start to see actually good rollout. Even things like the soft power of the presidency being able to give good guidance and best practices would be helpful. Like..."oh hey guys, north Dakota did really well with this practice for rural folks"
1/1	I have a history of anaphylaxis. I refilled my epipens, got the vaccine, and have been totally fine since, aside from a sore arm for a day or two
1/1	I have a lot of respect for you doc, I getting my second Moderna vaccine shot tomorrow
0/0	I have a simple question why can't they spend money on the Cure instead of the vaccine I already know the answer but I would like to know from you to answer me if is the same logical explanation of what i already know
1/-1	I have all the basics and more, I travelled to Ethiopia a few years ago for work so had boosters
1/-1	I have all the vaccinations I'm supposed to have.
1/1	I have already gotten both shots. To anyone who is skeptical I ask what are you afraid of?
1/1	I have always said I am not in a rush to get it but as it grows closer, I definitely look forward to getting it.
0/0	I have an autoimmune disease and will refuse to take it. I have immunity to COVID after having the Hong Kong flu in 1968. My young children were with me during the long 2 weeks my mom was there to help take care of them. I was exposed to COVID 6 times by family and a friend and did NOT get the virus My children, mom and I have never had any flu since 1968!
0/0	I have an autoimmune disorder (psoriasis) that has a high potential of becoming extremely bad if I receive the flu vaccine. And that is only a newly discovered adverse effect of THAT vaccine. I won't be rushing out for a Covid-19 vaccine because of the possibility of the same problem.
1/1	I have an elderly father in one country and an elderly mother-in-law in another, my wife and I have not seen them for a long time, so yeah, we will get vaccinated as soon as we can to be able to travel and visit them without infecting them.
1/1	I have autism and I HATE it when others say 'OoOo VaCcInEs CaUsE aUtIsM oOoO'
1/1	I have autism myself, and no. Vaccines do NOT give autism, autism is a disorder that some people get permanently upon birth.
0/-1	I have back pain
0/0	I have bad reactions to the Flu vaccine. I haven't taken the flu shot for years. I'm not going to risk the adverse reactions of the Covid19 vaccine.
1/1	I have been fortunate enough to get the covid vaccine.
1/1	I have been getting flu shots for the past 40 years, so ‚Äòyes‚Äô I will consider getting a vaccine for COVID 19 when it becomes available.
1/1	I have been offered an appointment for a COVID vaccine tomorrow. Which obviously will mean I will lie awake tonight panicking that it won't happen and feeling bad that I'm getting it when others haven't yet
1/0	I have been offered the vaccine, but I don't want to take it at this time. This is new technology never before tested on humans. What can possibly go wrong? I am not an anti-vaccer either. I have taken plenty of vaccinations (except for the flu vaccine), as I love to travel to really remote areas. What do you think of Ivermectin? Thank you.
1/1	I have been skeptical of all medications and vaccines in the past...but in this case I will take the vaccine and be THANKFUL for it!¬†Covid has cost us too much.
1/1	I have been trying to get an appointment for over 65 but I get a response in northern CA out of vaccines. I hope you push to get more vaccines available. Thank you.
1/1	I have been vaccinated and the only risk for me is the pain of the needle when it's injected into me ;-;
0/1	I have blood cancer, I need it to be 100%
0/0	I have cancer, my cancer drug already ramps my immune system up... I don't feel comfortable mixing it with the covid vaccine... I'll pass....
0/0	I have carefully studied the development of the covid vaccines and many things about them are very concerning to me
1/-1	I have epilepsy. How would the vaccine make my epilepsy react ??
1/1	I have friends that are antivax sorta. I just say. Cool I‚Äôll wave to you from the beach, the bar or sporting event and music festival, you can stay paranoid. They change their view pretty quick
1/1	I have had NO symptoms after taking both doses of the covid vaccine.
1/1	I have had Rona once already and still want to get the vaccine
0/0	I have had a severe reaction to flu shots in the past. I am allergic to nickel and Sulfa and these were ingredients in these shots which made me horribly ill for as long as 2 months and having to spend nights at the bathroom because crawling to the bathroom once took everything I had to get there. I have not taken any flu shots since the last time it caused devastating reactions for me in the late 90s. I never regretted it because I have not suffered from the flu since that horrible shot. How do I know that this shot does not contain these ingredients? I am reluctant to take the vaccine because I never fair well with secondary effects. I am allergic to opiates (such as Vicodin, morphine, and Norco), also statins, and can only tolerate a smaller dosage of lesser than 50% of Percocet without going under...as in induced into a comma I can't get out of for days. I avoid pharmaceuticals if there is a naturopathic alternative.
0/0	I have had an allergic reaction to a vaccine in the past. I‚Äôve already had COVID. I‚Äôve been told I should wait to get the vaccine. I‚Äôm very hesitant due to my allergies.
1/-1	I have had bad results from the 65 and over flu shot but the chance of getting a serious illness without it is a much greater risk! I will keep getting it!
1/1	I have had both vaccinations. After the first I felt like I had a slight hangover and a sore arm, after the second only a tender arm and nothing else. It is sooo worth getting if it means we can get back to some semblance of normality sooner rather than later.
1/1	I have had my covid19 vaccine. I have done it to protect myself , my partner and our daughter. It is worth it compared to catching covid
1/1/1/1/1	I have had my vaccine and am very grateful looking forward to the second one now. Starting to feel safer. Thankyou.
1/1	I have had my vaccine thanks. Looking forward having the second one.
1/1/1/1/1	I have had my vaccine. Thank you researchers for your ingenuity! Lifesaving work.
1/1/1/1	I have had the first dose. Can't wait for the second. My question for the anti vaccine brigade. Why would any government want to harm, track individual people. What is their objective you give all these horror scenarios, but WHY would every government in the world be doing this. My heartfelt love goes out to all the brilliant minds that have developed this vaccine for as I believe the GOOD for mankind.
1/1	I have had the first shot. No problems. Getting second shot 2/13. Very thankful.
1/1	I have had the first vaccine and looking forward to the second one this week. Two of my family members were hit with covid and I never want to go through the pain and suffering they went through. We need to kill this virus and I really believe that the vaccine is the only thing that will do it. To the people who are against the vaccine, I'd rather take my chance with the vaccine than taking my chance of catching the virus. We know and see what the after effects of the virus leaves you with so I will take my chance that the vaccine is had no after effects. And if it does surely it can't be any worse than the virus
1/1	I have little hope of getting the vaccine this month but maybe in March.
0/0	I have lived 30 years with multiple auto-immunity, more than one, I just feel that that the immune system is very complicated. I would not take a vaccine unless you can prove that it's 100% safe to take one for CoVid.
1/1	I have missed gping to work so much, happy that things might return to normal
1/1	I have my appointment Wednesday. I work in healthcare so I'm the only one in my family eligible. It will reduce the risk to all of us, but I really wish they could do it on a household basis. If my wife were to get sick, knowing I'm vaccinated I'll spiral into guilt. God forbid if she were to die what it'd do to me. Sure, I'll be healthy enough to take care of her, but there's not a whole hell of a lot you can do against a virus other than treat symptoms and I don't have a ventilation or ECMO laying around.
1/1	I have my flu vaccine every year because work pay for it and I don't get sick as often if I have it.
0/0	I have my sea moss, elderberry, and vitamin c. No need for vaccine.
0/-1/0	I have never had a flu jab either. I haven't had flu for 12 years. I live in London. Says it all.
0/0	I have never had a vaccine and at 66 years old I m not starting now
0/0	I have never seen a vaccine developed this quickly
0/0	I have never taken the FLU vaccines and I won't be taken any Coronavirus vaccines because I would like to die natural death. So people work with the WORLD health organisation can take all mine Coronavirus vaccines I don't want NO POISONS goinig into my my body
0/0	I have news for these tyrants: I will NEVER take their RNA-destroying "vaccine" under ANY circumstances! They attempt to rape me with a needle I'll protect myself with hot high-velocity lead!
1/1	I have not noticed any side effects at all, except a little sore arm.
1/1	I have not seen ANY headlines of covid vaccine creating an allergic reaction
1/1	I have noticed there is a marked increase in anti vaccine rhetoric under the guise of Christian belief. It is scary.They believe it‚Äôs a Scam,everything apparently.I really think they oppose what ever is being discussed. And they are all experts they can‚Äôt spell it,but they know!
0/0	I have permanent brain damage from the MMR immunization. I used to be very, very, very supportive of vaccines.
1/0	I have plenty of health issues right now so I will probably wait until they resolve before taking the vaccine.
0/0	I have problems concentrating - Effects from other vaccines that were injected into me without my permission when I was an Infant. So I couldn't get past 35 seconds of this video
1/1	I have read a lot of article's and watched a lot of different news programs and I believe the science in the vaccines. I do believe they will help and be a big benefit to all of us. I will do the humane and responsible thing to do and get the vaccine..
0/0	I have read reports of those who have had an terrible reaction and some deaths, after receiving the vaccine. Why are these reports being heard of? Why are the seemingly being hushed?
0/0	I have read that the vaccine permanently changes DNA and cells detrimentally. It may be fine now but in a year or next infection natural immunity is impaired forever. Want to understand what is being injected before I agree.
1/1	I have recieved both doses of the biontech vaccine and I'm fine. Do you want this pandemic to go on forever? Get woke people
0/0	I have saved my children from vaccinations because of a stranger at a business seminar that has informed me of his opinion about vax, 4yrs before I had my 1st kid. There are people that listen.
0/0	I have seen videos of side effects.
1/1	I have several diseases from epilepsy to autoimmune dysfunction and cannot receive vaccines due to adverse reactions in the past. But I would never force others to not get vaccines because I know that they wouldn‚Äôt have a reaction like I have.
0/0/0/0	I have sickle cell anemia. I'm not taking the vaccine until they do study on people like me. I'm on vitamin D3 and liquid vitamin A - zink. My diet is all organic I don't eat fast food, I cook my meals.
1/1	I have taken all the vaccines except the mmr vaccine because of allergy and I'm thankful to every person who takes that vaccine.
1/1	I have to agree with what has been said. Getting the COVID vaccine is beneficial not only for yourself, but for everyone around you. I believe that getting vaccinated is a way for me to do my part in combating this pandemic. I also agree with what others have said about the procedure of making the vaccine. The vaccine was expedited, as is understandable given the circumstances, but it still went through all the necessary steps that any other vaccine goes through. The number of health care workers and individuals in science fields who have received the vaccine also speaks to its reliability. If they had doubts about the vaccine they wouldn't be getting it in the first place.
1/1/1/1	I have to say I am relieved to see how many people want the vaccine. I was worried about the anti vax population but all I‚Äôve seen so far is people begging to get it
1/1	I have to say I want take it
1/1	I have underlying medical issues so I will be getting the Covid-19 vaccine when it's my turn and when my doctor tell me it's time. . . I am excited to get the shot
1/1	I have zero issue in taking a Covid19 vaccine when it's made available.
0/0	I have zero plans to ever get vaccinated for covid since it does not effect me. The only reason why I know that I had covid in the first place was due to serological testing.
1/1	I haven't had a minute to watch but I'm so glad you made a video about this! I just got mine Wednesday! I've had a sore arm and sore under arm
0/0	I haven't had a vaccine since I was a young child, 50 plus years ago. And I have never had any health problems
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I haven't had a vaccine since I was a young child, 50 plus years ago. And I have never had any health problems.
0/0/0/0/0	I haven‚Äôt been ill for 5 years nearly my whole year got covid and I‚Äôm fine I‚Äôm not taking the vaccine
0/0	I haven‚Äôt had a Flu shot since 1992, when I was 7. It must just a coincidence that 28 years later I still haven‚Äôt gotten the Flu.
1	I haven‚Äôt heard about any side effects, Even if we don‚Äôt trust it [will protect us], it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to get vaccinated.‚Äù
1/1	I hear you. I had a severe case of anaphylactic shock which almost killed me - but I wouldn't try to put others off having the vaccine because this reaction is rare and as a country we need to move on and get on with life.
1/1	I hear your concern about the rushed timeline, but I am a part of the Moderna trial and (very likely) received the vaccine and can say that it is safe with only minor side effects for ~12-14 hours after injections.
1/1	I heard a lot of "I'll let other people take it first to see how it goes" turn into I want to get it asap. So far so good
0/0	I heard it alters the person's DNA ??? Not in my body
0/0	I heard over a radio call in that the vaccine has a permanent sterilization effect. If so, would that be permanent sterilization for this USA and worldwide. If this is true what is the "ingredient" in the vaccine that would cause the sterilization????
0/0	I heard people are getting sick from it don't trust it
0/0	I heard some people died after having it
1/-1	I heard that the COVID-19 vaccines protect against the COVID-19 variants
0/0	I heard the vaccine only lasts for eight months then you need another one. I will not take it.
0/0	I heard there was someone dead after 2 hours getting the jab.
0/0	I highly doubt that's actually a Covid vaccine
0/0	I highly doubt there will be the same vaccine distributed to the poor and the rich, elite, 1%, politicians and certain families. Rothschi.....
0/0	I highly doubt there will be the same vaccine distributed to the poor and the rich, elite, 1%, politicians and certain families. Rothschi......
0/0	I honestly don‚Äôt know any sane person that is planning on getting it
1/0	I honestly wish I could have volunteered for the vaccine trials. I'm a full time mother of three, though, and couldn't take the risk. I'll be, masked, in that line with you.
1/1	I hope Pfizer can match the expected production. Would be nice to have 100 million doses per month.
1/1	I hope Pfizer reaches the expectations of people and manufacture as many as possible quickly
1/1	I hope everyone will be safer and happier and healthy now
0/0	I hope for once the jews are not involved in this hate crime against america. Do we have some names of people to blame yet?

1	I joined the #CovidVaccine club today. Thank you Israel. Feels good, like making progress towards better times.
1/1	I joined this sub early March when we all seemed to be doomed for unforeseeable years to come. Less than a year later, and two vaccines are being submitted to the FDA. Science is amazing. We‚Äôve come a long way.
1/-1	I just don't get it. Why do these anti-vaccine feel the need to stop others from getting a vaccine? If you don't want one that's fine by me.
1/1	I just don't know where to put my face after so many people using god as a foundation of anti vaccination, like can't you just shut up you embarrassing me in front of the atheist
0/0	I just don't take vaccines that I don't need. There's plenty vaccines I haven't got and I won't get a vaccine cause it's the in risk now.
0/0	I just don‚Äôt like being the very first person to try anything brand new.
0/0	I just don‚Äôt want to take a shot that was made in 9 months
1/1	I just finished listening to an Interview about vaccines where @LukwesaBurak was speaking with @melindagates , who praised Nigeria's efforts to end Polio and containing Ebola. Hoping that same efforts could be used on the #CovidVaccine to end this pandemic. NaijaFisted hand

1/1	I just got my second dose today!!
1/1	I just got my second dose yesterday, so that's me right now with the ibuprofen. The first one took me out for a day too, so thankfully I warned my boss ahead of time that I'd probably be taking a day off. Now I'm worried I'll be out for two.
1/1	I just got my second dose. Super happy I did , but I feel like shit. Body chills like I've never had before.

1/-1	I just got my vaccine yesterday. My body feels so heavy especially my left arm.
1/1	I just got my vaccine! No side effects as of yet!

1/1	I just got some joyful news: My first COVID-19 shot is coming up soon!
1/1	I just got the first vaccine. My arm is a little sore (the same amount of soreness I get from a flu shot). That's the only symptom
1/1/1/1	I just got the first vaccine. My arm is a little sore (the same amount of soreness I get from a flu shot). That's the only symptom. I feel perfectly fine otherwise!

0/1	I just had my second shot my teeth turned blue and hair fell out every time I turn on the microwave oven I fart the theme song to Jeopardy bark like a dog and poop my pants. Other than that I feel great I've never felt so woff ! woff ! woff ! Alive
1/1	I just hope that a lot of people do trust the vaccine despite it being made that fast.
0/0	I just learned you can‚Äôt sue the vaccine maker for side effects. Long term effects of mRNA vaccine is unknown. I personally know people who would rather take a conventional inactive vaccine instead of mRNA. We should change the current law.
1/1	I just ordered the Sputnik vaccine on eBay. It recommends 2 doses so I got 4 just to be sure. Only ¬£18.95 free postage
1/1	I just received my first dose (12/20) but still feel optimistic until 1/10 when I receive my second dose.
1/1	I just received my first dose of the vaccine! I hope you all are being safe and everyone can get it soon.
1/1	I just received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine yesterday. The only side effect that I experienced is "soreness" plus I also noticed that I am starting to talk and act like these two dudes. That's not cool, so don't call me culo!
1/1	I just recovered from Covid and I plan to get the vaccine as soon as I am allowed to do so.
1/1	I just signed up to see if they will take me in a phase 3 trial ü§ô
1/1	I just want a vaccine

1/1/1	I just want to be vaccinated...
1/1	I just want to get vaccinated
1/1	I just want to get vaccinated so I can go out and meet my girlfriend
0/1	I just want to see it be used a bit more and see the effects it has before I take it.
1/1	I keep waking up hoping the positive energy I put out there and good karma will finally come back my way and I can get a vaccine!
1/-1	I knew my nieces had autism since they were newborns. There was something off about them. They were always crying for no reason. I told my sisters And they didnt believe me. Grew up and then diagnosed. I knew before they ever got vaccinated
0/0	I knew two people that took the vaccine and guess what? The both dead and didn't even have the virus!
1/1	I know 3 people now who have died after contracting covid! It‚Äôs so upsetting that people don‚Äôt want to get the vaccine! It‚Äôs not just an insult to those who have died, it‚Äôs an insult to those who have developed the vaccine and have studied these sciences for years!
1/1	I know I looked away from the needle And yes, I know I need a tan But I am so confident that the #Covid19 vaccine is safe & effective that I decided to take it myself
0/0	I know a person that become autistic after get a vaccine
1/1	I know a woman who is 95 and had both MODERNA vaccines already ,she is doing fine afterwards
0/0	I know it was the vaccine that changed my baby cousin forever no one can tell me different
0/0	I know my bodys immune system has a 98% chance of dealing with it, why would I want or need a vaccine?
0/0	I know of other people that have died after receiving the vaccine as well but this is not being posted on the news...When was an elderly patient that had blotches all over the body within 24 hours receiving receiving the vaccine and died three days later
0/0	I know our technology has evolved tremendously but Nah....m
1/1	I know right........99.9% of the people who have taken the vaccines already are doing perfectly fine.......That 0.01% experiencing side effects just isn't worth the risk. Lmao.
1/1	I know some folks are against the vaccine, but some people I work with who had Covid have long-term fatigue and exhaustion. I got the vaccine. I hope you shake it shortly!
1/1	I know some people even had to call out from work because of this. Personally, having nothing to do makes me focus on the symptoms more so I would rather just go on with my days like normal.
1/1	I know that there are some black people who aren't trusting the safety of the COVID vaccine. As a black RN I encourage all African American's to get the vaccine. They aren't injecting you with COVID That's lie. If you're offered the vaccine take it and save your life!
1/1	I know that this still means wearing a mask, taking precautions, social distancing where possible, and doing my part to help our country develop herd immunity to this awful virus so I'll do it!
1/1	I know there are massive COVID vaccination deficits in the US and across the world. I hope that for all of those for whom the vaccine is available, that they choose to get vaccinated. Wear a mask, get vaccinated when you can, save a life.
1/1	I know this isn‚Äôt the kind of thing anyone else will really care about but my 82 yo parents just got their first Covid vaccinations. Crying happy tears because maybe I can see them again one day
0/0	I know two Doctors, one is a consultant surgeon, and neither of them are taking the vaccine until they know the long term side effects which will take years.
1/1	I know vaccines work
1/1	I legitimately cannot wait. Pump me up. Gimme one of each for all I care. I cannot go on day to day like this any more.
0/0	I like and love my immune system. My choice. My belief. No COVID19 vaccine. Period.
1/-1	I like how all these Armchair Doctors are angry in the comments.
0/0	I like how this video supposed to make you feel like it‚Äôs no big deal get the vaccine but I‚Äôm like I didn‚Äôt want it before and now I don‚Äôt want it even more.
1/1	I like how you think 3900000 deaths is absolutely nothing....Like mate come on! Even with 0.05% chance of death 3900000 people will die and HUMANITY says even a single death is a TRAGEDY. Unless your non human, You should probably go pro vaccine. Maybe better researched ones but still Pro vaccine
0/0	I like my DNA the way it is THANK YOU
0/0	I like that you know the vaccine is poison!
0	I like the 4th one, I won't be bloody taking anything, who's gonna make money out of this
0/0	I like these odds. I refuse to be part of a massive test of unknown side affects of rushed vaccine. I will take my chances with my own immune system. My body, my choice.
1/1/1/1	I like this presentation. Thanks for sharing this. I got my first Moderna vaccine about 10 days ago. I experienced a sore arm and a minor rash. Looking forward to getting my second one.
1/-1	I like to think about it this way: If you have serious reaction from the vaccine, imagine what it was like getting the real disease... If you have small to none side effects, then great!
1/1	I literally despise needles with my whole entire body and soul, but you know imma be the first to get that vaccine
1/1	I literally had a dream the other night that I got the vaccine. That‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs the entire dream. And it was great.
0/0	I live in Florida & the vaccine rollout has been absolute shit.
0/0	I live in Florida and if someone is walking up to my door and ready to stab me with a needle, this is a stand your ground state they better be wearing bulletproof vest
1/1	I live in a 4 gen. household & I‚Äôm w/students in person so I jumped on the #COVID19Vaccine as soon as I could. Getting vaccinated means I can better protect my family and school community from the daily risks we‚Äôre all living with.
1/1	I look forward to seeing american covid cases plummet once we are all vaccinated.
1/1	I love GMOS and Vaccines
1/1	I love how for 6 months peopla have been begging for a vaccine to be made and when one comes out they say it's "sus" and refuse to take it
0/0	I love how they narrate it like they're talking to a fucking child. Piss off and take yr vaccine with you.
0/0	I love how they say we need to get vaccines INTO people ...
1/1	I love seeing all of you get vaccinated! But don't post your vaccination cards on social media! Posting your vaccination card on social media could lead to a scam or even identify theft.
1/1	I love seeing more and more posts of folks getting their first shot. Gives the rest of us hope that we will be able to get one too. Thank you for taking care of us!!
1/1	I love the benefit of them.
1/-1	I love the line "do some research". Firstly, if I'm debating with you, I likely have a basic idea what I'm talking about, it's silly to automatically assume you just know more than people on a subject. Secondly, you know who's probably done the most research? The actual experts. The scientists, the researchers...and they tend to overwhelmingly say the same thing.
0/0	I love your show and family but I will not get the vaccine. No long term effects done. Scientists don't even know if it's one and done, yearly boosters needed, nothing. Look what thalidomide did to babies in the 60's.
1/1	I made my appointment in advance waiting for high risk health issues to be eligible in my state and have been so eager to get it and protect myself
1/1	I mean I've tried to sign up for almost every trial, so you could say I'm a bit impatient.
1/-1	I mean is there anyone who is not sceptical about this vaccine? I will definetly get the vaccine but I would rather wait a few weeks before it gets public.
1/1	I mean it's the same with any vaccine so I'll take it right away
1/1/1	I mean talking about side effects just look at the ones for paracetamol which is effectively used in most of the world as far as I know
1	I mean, I'm certainly going to want the vaccine, I just might want to be part of the second batch, just to be sure it's safe.
1/1	I mean, good? Better than the bin - the more people vaccinated, the better for everyone.
1/1	I met several health care workers in a CoViD_19 hospital, who refused vaccination ,citing reason that( Covishield) vaccine contains RNA! Neither RNA nor non- RNA vaccines are harmful .The eradication of Smallpox and Polio happened due to vaccines .
0/-1	I might consider it ten years from now
1/0	I might take the vaccine after maybe a year to see how people react. I just don't understand the vaccine panic and people sitting in lines for hours waiting for it which may put them at greater risk. If people relax and wait till it's all widely available things will go more smoothly.
0/0	I might trust the long term studies when they come out in a decade or so.
0/0	I more scared about the vaccine then about the virus
1/1	I must admit that I don‚Äôt believe anything the media says anymore. Despite that, I hope the vaccines work.
1/1	I must say, most of the replies to this are uplifting. Being one of the early cases, left with severe respiratory damage from it, I hope this effort prevents a lot of people from having to suffer what I have.
1/1	I myself received Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine recently. The only side effect was a sore arm. Everyone with access to a COVID-19 vaccine should take it. And the world should help Africa secure a steady supply, where virus mortality rates have shown a concerning rise.
0/0	I need more Info. For now, I'll social distance, eat well, exercise etc. Then 6 months from now see some results such as Is the vaccine more harmful than the virus or If the vaccine wipes out Covid-19

1/1	I need to get vaccine, so that I can get entry approval for Singapore. Please help me with this. I have been married for 1 year and unable to meet my husband, as my entry approval is rejected each time. Vaccine can help my chances for approval. Please help!

1/1	I needed to watch this video... I was hesitant about the vaccine at first but now that Dr. Seema explained it so well I will definitely be getting it. I think I just needed someone to tell me that I am overthinking it and she definitely got my head straight
1/1	I never considered not having the vaccine. In fact, I was looking forward to having it, I wanted to have it done. I‚Äôm anxious to get back to normal life as soon as possible.

0/0	I not taking vaccines during COVID-19
1/-1	I noticed that most of the people that are against this cannot spell or use proper grammar.
1/-1	I once almost chocked on food. Food nearly killed me. Therefore, I chose not to feed myself or my kids. Some may say that eating food supposedly ‚Äúprevents starvation‚Äù but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to ignore the risk. Choking. Bad taste. Food allergies. And so many other risks, that are so much worse than not eating food. If you choose to feed your kids potentially deadly food, that‚Äôs on you. But based on my 2 minutes of internet research, I will protect my kids, and not feed them. Anti vaxxers in a nutshell

1/1	I rather take a researched vaccine than risk the sideeffects of a random virus
0/0	I rather to make my own vaccine than taking the J&J's
0/0	I reacted to one Vaccine now I won‚Äôt vaccinate again.
1/1	I read all these anti-vax comments and I think to myself: I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
0/-1	I read somewhere that it‚Äôs only effective for 180 days max, is that true?
0/0/-1	I read that alot of Drs and nurses don't want to take it... and they are on the front lines.
1/0	I read that as "Covid vaccines are slowly spreading the virus" and almost started to cry.
0/-1	I really afraid about side effects of vaccine Damn those fu¬¢king Chinese
1/1	I really agree that healthy nutrition and vitamin C and D have their contribution to make but not in any way enough to get us out of this terrible mess. The vaccination programme is the only way.
1/1	I really don't get anti-vaxes I trust a trained doctor more than a small article on the internet
1/-1	I really don't get the people who are like "Who'd pay $1000 for a vaccine?" We are all paying vastly more than that for the lockdown? Obviously? I can only model this as "neurotypical doesn't money", which I worry is not a very empathetic or predictive model.
0/0	I really dont trust these people enough to get something like this from them if they are pushing this and making it free and it messes with your DNA in some way you got to be dumb if you take this.
0/0	I really don‚Äôt understand how the vaccine would be if any benefit for the very frail. I‚Äôve worked with hospice patients for 10 years and I didn‚Äôt even recommend the flu vaccine.
1/1	I really happy that vaccine will be made from COVID-19 i hope it come out soon because i really wanna for people‚Äôs life‚Äôs be saved from covid
1/1	I really hope this vaccine keeps all from catching this terrible virus
1/0	I really think that people should stop scare postings over the Vaccines...its frightening enough the whole situation without speculating and causing more angst
1/1	I really want the mRNA vaccines, although I'll take what I get. These sorts of vaccines from everything I've heard are revolutionary and may be the stepping stone to eliminating all sorts of ailments. NOVA had a show which talked about them very recently, and it's encouraging to say the least. Can we imagine a world where the flu is eliminated? Where, maybe, some cancers can be prevented? It's a brave new frontier for medicine, and I am hoping in our lifetimes we can see these vile diseases curtailed.
0/0	I really want to think there‚Äôs nothing wrong with the vaccine, I just can‚Äôt get there
0/0	I received an email from a doctor that there were many poisons in these vaccines
1/1	I received my 2nd dose this week. I‚Äôm so thankful and looking forward ahead.
1/0	I received my COVID 19 vaccine I have gotten 3 different types of cancer but otherwise feeling fine
1/1	I received my covid vaccine today! They are braving the cold & it went smoother than a chic-fil-a drive through. I‚Äôm so grateful to put covid behind me!
1/1	I received my first COVID-19 vaccine today. #COVID19 #WVStrong #MaskUpWV
1/1	I received my first dose and I'm a mother of a disabled, medically complex child. We have to do everything we can to protect our kids from this virus!
1/1	I received my first dose of the #CovidVaccine 24 hours ago @uihealthcare. It was a happy day, a triumph of science. It was also a sad day as hundreds of thousands of people around the globe are still getting infected every day.
1/1	I received my first dose of the Moderna Covid vaccine this afternoon. So far so good, zero side effects.
1/1	I received my first dose of the Pfizer about an hour ago and so far so good.
1/1	I received my first if two COVID-19 vaccines today. I was incredibly impressed with the efficient operation. Great job Howard County Health Dept!
1/1	I received my first one already (healthcare). Can't wait to get the second and be doing my part to get out of this mess. Yes, new vaccines are scary. The unpredictability of COVID and this crazy world we are living in seem even scarier to me.
1/1	I received my first shot about 3 weeks ago and will be going for the second soon. I had a mild reaction from the first one I got a headache and felt extreme fatigue the symptoms cleared up in 24 hours..my boss had both dose she did not react from the first one at all but the second one she had a reaction.. she had extreme fatigue, headache, joint pan, but in about 24 hours symptoms cleared up.. I would rather deal with the symptoms from the vaccine then the symptoms from the virus.. stay safe everyone..√∞≈∏‚Ñ¢¬è
1/1/1/1	I received my first vaccine today :)
1/1/1/1	I received my moderna vaccine 1 week ago, so far so good
1/1	I received my second dose of the Covid-19 Moderna vaccine. This was the recommended 28 days after my first dose.
1/1	I received my second dose yesterday! Can't wait till everyone can get it.
1/1	I received the Moderna vaccine 3 days ago. I feel fine so far
1/1/1/1	I received the Moderna vaccine 3 days ago. I feel fine so far.
1/1	I received the Pfizer vaccine today. I work at a post office and at least 10 of my customers are no longer alive due to Covid-19. One death is too many. One case is too many. I love my neighbors and customers as myself and will do all I can to protect them and keep them safe.
1/1	I received the Pfizer vaccine today. Thank you for your helpful info!
1/1	I received the first dose of the vaccine and thanks to this video I now have a better understanding of why and how the vaccine works.
1	I received the first vaccination of the Moderna vaccine this morning and I had heat flashes and sweating after 10 minutes but it went away really fast and I was back to normal.
1/1	I received the vaccine and didn't have any of these issues. Its ridiculous that these problems are even coming up for people.
1/1	I received the vaccine and no problems here thankfully.
1/1	I recieved a phone call from my GPs practice on the 6th Jan informing me that I was to receive my vaccination on the 8th Jan. Brilliant so efficient the practice was so well laid out with Marshall to assist one to enter and a well distanced area to wait the 15min after the vaccination. Great service by fantastic caring people. Thank you NHS
1/1	I recieved the vaccine 1st dose this past friday and I feel absolutely fine my arm was a lil sore.
1/-1	I recommend the Oxford jab personally. As acedemics here will live and die by that method. The issue being Security services are rife within that sector. As in Oxford is mi5 and mi6 recruitment and training territory. Other than that, I would look at evidence and make your own choice. The Pfizer vaccine is filthy trash, stay away.
0/0	I refuse that so called vaccine. Can't make me get it either. I like living too much!
0/0	I refuse to be a science project!
0/0	I refuse to be forced by our government to get a vaccine until I know more about it, the side effects, etc. I seriously doubt there has been enough research done on this. I‚Äôm not going to be a guinea pig.
0/0	I refuse to get any vaccine
0/0	I refuse to have any vaccine ... we don‚Äôt know what is in them
0/0	I refuse to take any of the vaccines Pfizer or AstraZeneca. They are meant to kill us
0/0	I refuse to take it until it has been distributed to millions of citizens over a period of several months across geographies and demographics, and it has been verified outside the laboratory as safe and effective.
0/0	I refuse to take that shit! There is no guarantee that all these vaccines are safe considering the people who died from them . Taking this vaccine is like committing a suicide...
0/0	I refuse!!
1/1	I remember going to get the polio vaccine when I was a kid. My ex husband had polio. He got it when he was 5 years old. He spent 1 year in an iron lung. His age, just missed getting vaccinated. Forever changed his life. Vaccinations can save lives. Plus, help keep the economy improving.
1/1	I remember my science teacher used to wear a shirt that said: Got Polio? Me neither. Thanks science!
0/0	I run 2 very large pharmaceutical injury groups and many have buried people because of vaccines. I won‚Äôt be getting any vaccines ever again
1/1	I said No Way at first but after doing some reading and listening to experts in the medical and science community I decided to get the vaccine.
1/1	I said No Way at first but after doing some reading and listening to experts in the medical and science community I decided to get the vaccine. I get my first shot tomorrow! I‚Äôm ready!
0/0	I say be patient and allow sufficient time to research the hell out of Covid-19 vaccines because the long term side effects are still unknown. I am not even hopeful that science will ever beat a coronavirus
0/0	I say be patient and allow sufficient time to research the hell out of Covid-19 vaccines because the long term side effects are still unknown. I am not even hopeful that science will ever beat a coronavirus. Sars-Cov2 seems to be exposing the arrogance within the scientific community.
1/1	I see from your bio that you are a runner. Are you happy on taking the chance to 'survive' but never run again because you lungs are shot to bits as a consequence of long COVID? The vaccine also reduces severity of COVID among those who do not develope full immunity.
1/1	I see how you can be nervous, but you need to trust it. We have passed mass human trials, it is safe.
1/0	I see people saying covid vaccine is different but not giving any reasoning other than the rare vague statement that it is untested. What is the actual argument? You can't change someone's mind with vagueries
1/1	I see so many people dismissing this virus, and that makes me sad - thank you to these amazing scientists. Covid is really quite horrific and I don‚Äôt even know what kind of internal damage has been done to me. One thing is for sure - I‚Äôd gladly have the vaccine right now if I could because my biggest immediate fear is getting this virus again.
0/0	I see that ethics and morals is no longer applicable in medicine, it's become corrupt with profit.
1/1	I see too many anti-vax things from friends, so as a concerned mom every now and then I need to rewatch this video to remind myself to ignore them. I love this video!
1/1/1/1/1	I see vaccines like seatbelts. If you're in a serious car accident and are wearing a seatbelt it isnt 100% guaranteed you're going to survive. But you have a higher chance of surviving by wearing a seatbelt then those who choose not to wear a seatbelt and get into a car accident.
0/0	I shall not be rushing off to have any of these novel mRNA vaccines which have no proven efficacy or beneficial health outcomes since there is no clear evidence in the medical literature. Instead I am having my immune status measured by a private appointment with a Consultant in immunology and respiratory disease. So far I have not had Flu or Covid-19 and I am 90!
1/1	I shoulda got the vaccine when I had the chance. I was being too skeptical
1/1	I still believe in science
1/1	I still don‚Äôt get Anti-Vaccine people, I wonder what‚Äôs making them scared when the doctors literally said it‚Äôs safe..https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=youtube&uilel=3&passive=true&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fsignin%3Faction_handle_signin%3Dtrue%26app%3Ddesktop%26hl%3Dde%26next%3D%252Fwatch%253Fv%253DSSuxVwMkcpA&hl=de
0/0	I still don‚Äôt know if I wanna get the vaccine because what if the government wants people to die and he does not wanna tell us.What does the government wants us to take the vaccine so that more people can get sick and die
0/0	I still mistrust the COVID-19 vaccines
0/0	I still retain the right to control what goes in my body. You may be confident that these corporations and government have your best interest in mind, I'm not.
0/0	I still scare,I only vac.ones for the flu.I don't want too.
1	I stopped when they started interrupting people. Get your vaccines, it's better than being dead.
1/1	I suffer bad anxiety and panic with anything medical. I‚Äôm stressing over not feeling well after having it done but it‚Äôs our duty to do it to save lives. I want an end to all this death. Pleading face
1/0	I suggest that this vaccine be given to the politicians and bankers first.
0/0	I suggest you look up the history of recalled drugs for your country and the EU. Even in normal times, drugs make it through the testing process that turn out to be dangerous. So the idea of not wanting to take a vaccine that is being rushed and under-tested isn't "not trusting science". It's wanting the full science to be applied to the drug.
0/0	I sure as heck am NOT taking that thing
1/1	I suspect that the general population trust a scientifically tested vaccine far more than Konspiracy Karen on the comments section.
1/1	I take a flu shot every year. Instead of autism, I only get minor pain for like 2 hours.
1/1	I take my vaccine asap
0/1/1	I take the vaccine , after that i have all the symptoms of covid
1/1	I take the vaccine , after that i will feel great.
1/-1	I think 70% of the population should take the Covid vaccine. Would y‚Äôall let me know when you‚Äôre finished?
0/0	I think Big Pharma is insisting on vaccines to give cover for massive nuclear contamination. Vaccines CAUSE almost the same symptoms that exposure to radioactive contamination, only often more immediately apparent (nuke exposure takes 4-7 generations to show up the worst effects).
0/0	I think I will pass on the vaxx and take my chances.
0/-1	I think I will still take my chances and wait a while
0/0/0/0	I think I'll wait about 15 years before trying this out
0/0	I think I‚Äôll take my chances with my own immune system thanks! If I happen to get it (as a working nurse through it all, still hasn‚Äôt happened) than I‚Äôd feel safer going with treatments than an experimental vaccine
0/-1	I think I‚Äôll wait for a few more guinea pigs to try it out. Maybe next year.
0/0	I think a mandatory vaccine order would be the end of civilization. I am sure sandnigger know it, too. I don't think it'll happen, but if it does, buckle in.
1/1	I think having those side effects (if they exist) is better than being dead
1/1	I think if there is a vaccine made... it should be illegal NOT to get it, if you are able to get vaccinated.( I‚Äôm not talking about people who are allergic and who can not get it for medical reasons) by willingly refusing to get it , you are actively killing people and you should be thrown in jail.
1/1	I think it is important and I am not throwing my shot away!
1/1	I think it should be law to have it
1/1	I think it shows the FDA panel is taking the approval process and the scientific merits of the data seriously at least! which is good IMO
0/0	I think it speaks for itself these vaccine companies are protected from making things right if they kill/hurt people... Just saying.
0/0	I think it was rushed through very early, very quickly. So I would like a little more data
0/0	I think it's already too late late people can't open their eyes and see the truth. And I won't take that back scene I have never had a flu shot and I do just fine.
0/0	I think it's more dangerous to get the vaccine than take my chances getting Covid.
0/0	I think it's more dangerous to get the vaccine than take my chances getting Covid. If Biden becomes President, he'll force us all to get it against our will.
1/1	I think it's vital to get the vaccination out to the Refugee camps around the world. They have to suffer horrid conditions as it is, this just makes things worse for them. I just Pray that our Lord Jesus Christ keeps them safe
0/0/0/-1	I think its all a sick sick lie and the damn mark of the beast in n a way people change this is u zee
0/0	I think it‚Äôs reasonable to be skeptical about anything you put into your body, including vaccines
1/0	I think people forget or unaware of what vaccines do: they trigger an immune response. Side-effects are expected.
0/0	I think possible death , keeps me from vaccinating, the healthiest people i know have never been vaccinated
0/0	I think possible death , keeps me from vaccinating, the healthiest people i know have never been vaccinated, fact
0/0/0/0/0	I think possible death , keeps me from vaccinating, the healthiest people i know have never been vaccinated, fact .
1/1	I think that if the current mRNA vaccines hold up and work as well as they're supposed to and there are no long term effects they are the future for many things. The ability to plug and play is very cool.
0/0	I think that we should wait, atleast three years, to see the results, in the long term, of the vaccine.
1/1	I think that when being vaccinated becomes compulsory in order to return to some sort of normalcy - to go on holiday or watch live sport. Many people‚Äôs scepticism will melt away as quickly as it appeared. Preferring instead to get on with their lives!
0/0	I think the global panic has lead to a vaccine being rushed and 5 months of testing is, in my totally uneducated opinion, not long enough to prove there won't be any adverse effects down the line.
1/1	I think the legitimacy of the vaccine is very promising.
0/0	I think the scientific method of experimentation is overlooked on test and analysis.
1/1	I think the vaccine is ok. I like the speaker.
1/1	I think the vaccine is our best chance to end the pandemic.
0/0	I think the vaccine is too rushed and it's a competition between several countries in the world. I don't think I need one. The COVID19 isn't more dangerous than the flu for young people like me.
1/1/-1	I think there will be a ton of people who will refuse to get the vaccine unfortunately
0/-1	I think these comments are absolutely fantastic! it's gives me peace in my heart to know that people from all over the world are AWAKE!! iv researched this for years (among everything else) and it's felt like a lonely & frustrating place sometimes! But to now see how many people know their agenda is refreshing! ALL YOU NEED IS YOUR OWN IMMUNITY!! WE DO NOT CONSENT!!
1/-1	I think this is ok. Why because it's truth.
0/0	I think unicef you are the one who created this virus, good people say no to this vaccine, trust GOD ONLY.
1/1	I think we overestimate the amount of anti vaxxers. I think itsjust that they're the vocal minority so sometimes especially online it can appear that everyone is an anti vaxxer even though it isn't true
0/0	I think you'll find that more people will so no to the jab(if they have any sense).
0/0	I though a vaccine has to be tested against the actual virus before it should even be called a vaccine for it. Lets just call it what it is. A guess.
0/0	I thought it was done using the "bypassing all required testing and get it done as quickly as possible approach", combined with the "let's produce tens of millions of doses while we are still testing it, so we can make the most money out of this BS plandemic approach" ...
1/-1	I thought the first wave of vaccines were for emergency workers, hospital workers and other important people?
1/1	I thought the same thing initially to - no way would I be first to get the vaccine...after almost a year of COVID, I'm SO ready for my shot! I want to be able to hug my dad again....and not worry about my mom. I want my daughter to get back to school
0/1	I told my mom I wanna join the volunteer group but being a typical asian she gave me that deadly stare..its not the virus I'm scared of
1/1	I too had chicken pox but mine weren't to bad no scars. At 56 my doctor had me get the shingles vaccine as my insurance paid for it. Soon as I'm allowed I'll get the Covid vaccine. Like the flu. I was so sick in 1995 from it that was enough. I get the flu vaccine yearly & haven't had the flu again
1/1/1	I took Pfizer yesterday am fatigued and Have chills am Glad I took off today bc I wouldn't have been able to go to work but other than that am fine arm a Lil sore which is to be expected
1/1	I took mine on Tuesday. Felt like a normal flu shot and my arm was sore for 2-3 days.
1/1	I took my first shot of the vaccine today and advise you all to take it
1/1	I took the Pfizer vaccine when offered and also have a multitude of allergies. I was a bit anxious but... all went fine. No reaction at all. To some commenters, who are fearful, please do a risk and benefit analysis when thinking about taking the vaccine. Your risk of getting the virus is far greater than having an adverse reaction.
0/0	I took the flu shot but won't take covid vaccine
1/1	I totally trust the covid vaccine
1/1	I tried continually from 9:00 and was not able to book a time! Site kept referring me to the next available time which was already booked when I tried to schedule it! I am 75.
0/0	I trust Allah Not Vaxx.
1/1	I trust Johnson & Johnson.
1/1	I trust Johnson & Johnson. Others less so.

0/-1	I trust that we'll maintain a healthy lifestyle and immune system and pray for the wellbeing of our nation.
1/1	I trust the vaccine.
0/0	I trust this vaccine like i trust my government! Not at all!
1/1	I understand and support the priorities of who gets the vaccine first. However, I am also counting the days when I can get vaccinated
0/0	I understand it doesn‚Äôt stop you getting Covid or stop you passing it on to others.
0/0	I understand that we are not at risk so don't force us to do what you want
0/0	I understand their refusal. This vaccine was rushed and the long term effects are unknown.
1/1	I urge everyone to get the vaccine when they are offered it. It is safe, will help save lives and is the route out of the pandemic.
1/1	I used to be anti vaccine. This week I got my eldest son (aged 3) his first vaccines and his younger brother is getting his in the next couple of week. As a mother I was terrified to harm my child with vaccines. My 3 year old didn‚Äôt even have a temperature after his injections. Don‚Äôt let fear stop you from protecting your children and it‚Äôs also ok to realise that you were wrong
0/-1	I used to think doctors were brilliant
1/1	I vaccinate because I believe in science
1/1	I vaccinate because I'm not retarded.
1/-1	I volunteer as tribute
0/0	I walked to Tesco this morning through empty streets, thinking :"This is how it will be when the vaccines have killed most of the population"
1/1	I wanna get myself vaccinated as soon as possible so I can feel safe by touching my face. I‚Äôm tired of avoid touching my face and tired of worrying about things being contaminated.
0/0	I wanna see what happens to Bill Gates and Fauci after they take a daily dose of this "vaccine" for a month
1/0	I want a choice in what vaccine I'll choose to be inoculated with. Soon a single shot, temperature stable, viral vector vaccine will be available -- a game changer for sure
1/1	I want a choice in what vaccine I'll choose to be inoculated with. Soon a single shot, temperature stable, viral vector vaccine will be available -- a game changer for sure...üëç!
0/0	I want a guarantee from the company selling covida vaccine. The guarantees from the government are unfounded and absurd because it has sold the Nation and it falls every day. In the case of vaccine complications, I bring a case to the Court for damages of millions. compensation from the Government are nonsense .. because they don't have their money ... only ours. How am I supposed to pay myself compensation ... total nonsense
1/1	I want all this to end.. The vaccine is the way to move and do something to progress finally!!
1/0	I want everyone to be safe and healthy, I want Covid numbers to go down.
1/1	I want it I want to go to vacation
1	I want my normal life back! Guys get your fucking vaccine shots!
1/1	I want my vaccine
1/1	I want my whole family to get this vaccine as soon as possible! My daughter is super high risk. I want the vaccine to be cleared for kid so she can get back some semblance of normal. She's been "locked" in my house for a year.
0/0	I want none of that vaccine. I agree with them! It came super fast, no studies over long-term effects at all.

1/1	I want the vaccine
1/1	I want the vaccine now!
1/1/1	I want the vaccine, but I'm about to start 5 rounds of radiation and chemo soon, and someone told me that the since that will pretty much ruin my immune system, it would take out the effects of the vaccine anyway. Is that true of an RNA vaccine?
1/-1	I want the world to go back to normal BABY !!!
1/1	I want this vaccine

1/1	I want to share: I am vaccine shy (allergic to a lot of things), just got my 2nd COVID shot & happy to say I‚Äôm still here! Wasn‚Äôt even abducted by aliens or another adverse reaction. I also want to share: GIF starring
1/1	I want to take the vaccine but I‚Äôm not old enough to be vaccinated at current stage lol
1/1	I want to travel again so Im all for the vaccine
0/-1	I want to wait and see how it works before getting vaccinated
0/0	I was 50/50 on deciding if I would take it not. Now it‚Äôs a 100% chance I won‚Äôt be taking it.
1/1	I was a bit sceptical about the Covid vaccine, but after listening to anti-vaxxers, I have now fully changed my mind and I‚Äôm 100% pro vax. No way I‚Äôm associating myself with these idiots
1/1	I was actually worried about the vaccine, but knowing they didn't cut corners makes me feel 100% better. Thank you so much for posting it, my family will absolutely vaccinate as soon as we can
1/0	I was an absolute pro-vaxxer as well. TTAV series changed me. I am not Anti-Vaccine But I do think Vaccines are not as safe as we are told. Definitely a risky business!
1/1	I was born in 1965 with rubella, my mother tells how it was the scariest thing that ever happened in her life when I nearly died as a newborn. I dont know why I was lucky enough to survive, without life long issues related to rubella. Vaccines have saved millions of children since 1965, babies are vulnerable, it's so important to vaccinate yourself and protect them.
0/0	I was conflicted until I spoke with my doctor. Since the CDC does not know all the side effects. and adverse effects of taking either vaccine. I declined and will continue to isolate.
1/1	I was fortunate and grateful to get the first dose of my #COVID19 vaccine today
1/1	I was given the pfizer vaccine and I'm still alive and had no side effects.
1/1	I was hesitant about the vaccine at first but now that Dr. Seema explained it so well I will definitely be getting it

1/1	I was hoping for your usual introduction. But thanks for this video. I can‚Äôt wait for my vaccine.
1/1	I was in the study, I now have immunity, the side effects were minor.
0/0	I was just reading an article in new republic independent propaganda news online... under an article under the apocalypse category, called something like ‚Äòare we ready for the vaccine‚Äô ... they talked about the ‚Äòquick‚Äô method they are using for future plandemics... they are planning to create more pandemics to scare the sheeple for more vaccines. This is not going to be the last of these plandemics.
1/1	I was just talking to a friend who's waiting for the vaccine. At first he thought he would have no trouble getting the shot, but apparently a lot more people are volunteering so that's a good sign.
1/-1	I was literally waiting to get the vaccine when the video was uploaded
1/1	I was literally waiting to get the vaccine.
1/1	I was nervous about having mine, not least because I‚Äôm scared of needles and because i had heard about side effects. However in my case the jab was one of the easiest I‚Äôve ever had and aside from my arm feeling like I‚Äôd been punched the following day, i had no other issues. I strongly recommend everyone having it when possible.
0/0	I was never an anti vaxxer but covid 19 lies & manipulation has turned me into one.
1/1	I was part of that trial and had minimal ill effects so i am super excited to be part of a solution like this!
1/1	I was registered, I was ready. The vaccination clinic was cancelled the day before it was supposed to happen.
1/1	I was scheduled to get a vaccine after seeing my doctor but the appointment was cancelled due to shortages, but if I can get a new appt I am still 100% on board with getting the shot. I will feel much safer
1/1	I was second guessing the vaccine but I‚Äôm ready now!
1/1	I was so relieved my country was getting the vaccine in a few months, I've been neurotically cleaning and staying safe and just when I thought I was in the final lap, I got the Rona üòÇ.
1/1	I was talking to a physician at a regional medical center over the weekend. At his hospital, over 95% of the physicians have chosen to get vaccinated, and just 45% of the nursing staff. I found that disheartening.
1/1	I was vaccinated Siobhain...very sore and nauseated but subsided just waiting for another 10 days for 2nd dose..hope you have got vaccinated thank you for your vlogs.
0/-1	I was vaccinated...I had the chickenpox, measles and the mumps and had the flu on a yearly basis. So what did I have injected in me?
1/-1	I was very curious about this vaccine and a lot of my questions are answered. Thank you.
1/1	I wasn‚Äôt gonna get it but i Changed my mind it‚Äôs either get the vaccine or die from covid and plus it‚Äôs saving people‚Äôs life‚Äôs as well
1/1	I wasvaccinated on 01/22, still doing good! Had mild soreness at site of injection for first two days. No other symptoms, but still monitoring
1/1/1	I watched a lot of videos about the Pfizer vaccine to try and understand how it works but this was the first one that made it clear yet simple to understand. Thank you!
1/-1	I watched the video of the nurse getting vaccine this morning and tried hard to squint to see it (imo correctly) as incredible / exciting as eg SpaceX launches
1/1	I welcome both this article & the vaccine. It's a remarkable achievement. But I can't help wondering whether this type o vaccine is just too expensive & too difficult to transport to have a long term future. Most of us will get something like the Astra Zeneca jab next year. Let's hope the optimum dosage issue can be resolved soon.
0/0	I will NEVER take a vaccine. It's the common cold and the survival rate is damn near 100%. I do support Trump but unfortunately he's been fooled in regards to the vaccine. Not really his fault, it's corrupt ass Fauci and MSM feeding the frenzy over nothing. COVID-19 is the COMMON COLD!!!
0/0/0/0	I will NEVER take it, if you are vaccinated you are supposedly safe, so mind your business.
0/0	I will NEVER take this vaccine
1/0	I will NEVER vaccinate my child. Some doctor will do it for me
0/0	I will NEVER vaccinate my children ever again!
0/0	I will NOT be a guinea pig for an unnecessary vaccine. Recovery rate is 99.6 %. So why an unproven vaccine. Try it out in 3rd world countries for the next 5 years and I might consider it.
0/0	I will absolutely refuse to take a coronavirus vaccine.
1/1	I will absolutely take it, though I‚Äôm way down the end of the priority list. I live in Amsterdam, but I‚Äôm Irish and my in-laws are Spanish. We haven‚Äôt seen my family since February, including my elderly father in Ireland who is not in the best of health, and the Spanish family since Christmas. Two of my siblings who live in the US haven‚Äôt met my 17-month-old yet and her family on both sides are missing out on some of the most special times of her life.
0/0	I will agree for an early election and get rid of the lot. Vaccine goes with them ...sortedüëçüëçüëçüëç
0/0	I will be fine if I get COVID, so I'm not taking it
1/1	I will be getting it to promote herd immunity and protect those that cannot get the vaccine, and I would love to travel internationally again!
1/1	I will be getting mine as soon as I am allowed!!! It‚Äôs the only way to stop this pandemic!!!
1/1	I will be getting my covid shot in early February on the occasion of my 75th birthday because I don‚Äôt want to die just now. I‚Äôll do that later at a time of my own choosing.
1/1	I will be getting the vaccine asap. My parents are both in several high risk categories. I have been so scared for them and want to protect them as much as possible.
1/1	I will be happy to get vaccinated as soon as it‚Äôs available to me. I am not a scientist any more, but I generally trust the drug companies to do their jobs correctly, and not put out a vaccine that is extremely unsafe.
1/1	I will be in line as soon as it is offered!
1/1	I will be in quarantine for a full year on March 2nd I GENUINELY hope I have mine by then. I just got a letter from my doctors (post lung transplant clinic) today saying ‚ÄúCOVID has highly adverse risks‚Äù - for you etc. then ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know anything essentially‚Äù. This is the first letter in the pandemic they‚Äôve sent me at all I‚Äôm just here like ????? at this point. I just want my shot and this to be done.
0/0	I will be taking a very cautious wait to see how the vaccines play out. I had an extremely bad experience with the flu vaccine many years ago.
1/1	I will be taking it, no doubt. Got vulnerable family members.
1/1	I will but waiting on the testing to confirm that the vaccines do work on the our variant for Covid. Otherwise I feel it will be kinda pointless take it and then I get variant. The AstraZeneca vaccine does seem promising at the moment though.
0/0	I will decline my vaccine thanks
1/1	I will definetly get the vaccine but I would rather wait a few weeks before it gets public.
1/1	I will definitely get it!
1/1	I will definitely get it, but I won't be first in line either.
1/1/1/1/1/0	I will definitely get the vaccine,but I want to give it some time before I do.
1/1	I will definitely take it. But I have a feeling that the Covid vaccines are more of a flu shot type of vaccine where you will have to take another few shots till the vaccine is perfect and able to fend off the new variant strains. That's is my opinion.
1/1	I will definitely take the vaccine. I will still get Covid sooner or later. Better to get vaccinated than to be infected with a fully developed disease by some disgusting laboratory virus from China.
1/1	I will do anything to travel and live normally again!!!
1/1	I will do it asap
0	I will fight for my right to not be injected with something I don't trust at all.

1/1	I will get it
1/1	I will get on the first day it‚Äôs available to me
1/1	I will get the vaccine as soon as I qualify. I‚Äôve had Covid and have donated plasma 8 times.
1/1	I will get the vaccine as soon as it is available to my cohort. I am a senior working in an essential job in retail grocery
1/1	I will get the vaccine myself.
1/1	I will get vaccinated for the sake of others, not myself
1/1	I will got vaccined yesterday and honestly i feel fine! It was a good choice, I feel more secure noww
0/0	I will happily wait for the human guinea pigs to complete beta testing Call me if humanity survives. Until then I‚Äôll be wearing my mask and washing my hands....at a distance.
1/1	I will line up to get an effective and safe vaccine as soon as one with FDA approval is available to me because I‚Äôm 59 years old, I‚Äôve had asthma and COPD since I was 10, and a heart attack a few years ago‚Ä¶and I don‚Äôt want to die.
0/0	I will never accept this vaccine even at a gun point. No vaccines to Africa

1/1	I will never understand the hate for vaccines. My grandma has polio as a child. She forever walks with a limp and has needed a walking stick her entire life because of it. One leg is longer than the other because of her battle with polio. You know what her kids, me and my kids never got. Polio... thanks to a fucking vaccine.
0/0	I will not be a human guinea pig for big pharma to profit off me, and then I can't sue them for damages.
0	I will not be experiencing any side effects seeing that I‚Äôm not a sheep and refuse to get the poison injection.
0/0	I will not be getting a vaccine that is being ultra-rushed, not properly trialed, and the manufacturers have no liability if it harms.
0/0	I will not be getting a vaccine.
0/0/0/0	I will not be getting it. I have had too many bad reactions from vaccines. Also this is brand new technology with Pfizer and Moderna's synthetic mRNA. I'm not willing to be a guinea pig. I will remain isolated and masked up and sanitized until it is safe.

0/0	I will not vaccinate my children! It is harmful and dangerous.

1/1	I will take it the minute I can. I dont care about any side effects or damage people claim it does.
1/1	I will take it, I think that although I‚Äôm not very comfortable with the idea that it‚Äôs brand new and not a massive amount of information regarding side effects, I would very much like to be able to attempt to get society and general life back on track as at present (in the UK) being locked down and unable to see loved ones is putting a lot of negatives on my mental health.

1/1	I will take the vaccine, i just want this Pandemic to end now!
1/1	I will take the vaccine. I'm not really particularly afraid of the disease for my own part as I'm pretty young and otherwise healthy, but I want to be able to live fairly normally again without risking infecting someone else with something that is potentially dangerous for them.
1/1	I will take this vaccine
1/1	I will take this vaccine for the sake of humanity! I am a HERO!
1/1	I will take this vaccine.
1/1	I will wait for a different vaccine, not a j&j one. They have blood on their hands.
0/0	I will wait to get the covid vaccine until it is proven safe. My son died in 2006 from a reaction to the anthrax vaccine when he was in the army! They said it was safe too! I do get a flu shot every year, not against vaccines just don't like the ones that aren't fully tested.
0/0	I will wait until I see what happens to those who received the vaccine üíâ. It‚Äôs not 100% effective... that makes me feel apprehensive
1/0	I will, so long as there are no health contraindications, or anything else about the vaccine which would conflict with my beliefs.

1/1	I wish I could have the vaccine
0/0	I wish I could have the vaccine but it‚Äôs too cold for me
1/1	I wish I was in line to get it üòûüòû. I guess healthy people have to wait and wait wait üôÑüôÑ.
0/0	I wish more melanated people would do their research instead of trusting the vaccine
1/1	I wish my postal carrier housemate would get hers too, but she doesn't want to take it until it's been many months to be sure there is no side effects. Do to my comorbidities, covid would probably kill me, so it's a clear choice. I wish it was for her, too, but alas, it isn't.
1/1	I wish people would take it seriously so we can try to get back to normal in the future
1/1	I wish there was a way to make being antivax punishable by death. That is the only thing that can stop them.
1/1	I wish they would have Started with younger people who have Children who need both of there parents,
1/1/1	I wish this mRNA thing works out and we get to have faster and more effective vaccines for now on. The flu vaccine is not even 50% effective and this new vaccine is about 95% effective.
1/1/1/1	I wish to get vaccine immediately so that i can go out to meet my friends before i'll become insane
1/1	I wish to get vaccine immediately so that i can go out to meet my friends before i'll become insane -_-"
0/0	I won't be controlled by the government. I'll pass on this one..

0/0	I won't be taking any covid test, or vaccine and will be encouraging others not to. I haven't worn a mask or washed my hands since the scandemic began and yet here I am fit as a fiddle with my vegan diet. Men who dig pits for others will fall in it themselves.

0/0	I won't take this ever. I'll rely on my immune system thanks
1/1	I wonder how many people here making comments would have shunned the polio vaccine. Or the measles or all of the other vaccines that came out years ago. Everybody seems to think they are a doctor.
1/0	I wonder if this data will bring about a change in the policies of some countries not to use this vaccine on the over 65s. Lets hope its not too late for this obvious error to be corrected.
1/0/1	I wonder what the ‚Äúanti-Vaxers‚Äù are thinking about this stuff, like are they considering getting vaccinated now?
0/0	I wont be having it. Im pro choice not anti vaxx. I will figth tooth and nail not to have it.
0/0	I wont even get the test, forget it. Ill lose jobs if I have to and scrap metal or work under the table. No brain q tip and no needles. They sent a few people to test at my job who were in contact with others who tested positive. I swear if they come my way Ill grab my jacket say "hold on a sec" and walk out the door. Fuck all this bs
0/0	I wont take a flu shot if it has side affects. How do they expect me to take covid vaccine after saying it has side affects?
0/0	I wont take the flu shot never have. And I will never take the covid vaccine.
0/0	I wont take this vernomous poisons never .
0/0	I won‚Äôt be having a rushed vaccine, perhaps when they understand the side effects and that won‚Äôt be for quite a while yet.
0/0	I won‚Äôt be taking a vaccine at all ! I can read facts & a man with zero medical knowledge in less than a year safely made a vaccine for covid ?? Wow ! He should now work on a vaccine for cancer , should only take what 6 months of so ? All the BS aside how can this vaccine be regulated and safe ?? Facts I‚Äôve read , it‚Äôs not !
0/0	I won‚Äôt be taking a vaccine for covid. I don‚Äôt take a flu vaccine either, even though I‚Äôve been offered it, simply because it‚Äôs my choice. I‚Äôm not anti-vax nor am I an idiot. If someone decides to take it then that‚Äôs their choice. Respect both choices or non.

1/-1	I work in a nursing home. Still haven't gotten mine yet.
0/0	I work in health care. I wont be getting the vaccine. I wont be telling others to do it either.
0/0	I work in healthcare. We've had 3 elderly people who took this vaccine and ended up in emergency situations (fainting, hard to breathe, etc). I personally, don't trust it because I am black. I remember the Tuskegee experiment they unleashed in my ancestors. These vaccines aren't made with all ethnicities genetics in mind.
1/1	I work in senior living and we are anticipating receiving our vaccines mid/end of January - early February. I‚Äôm nervous to get it but I‚Äôm thankful to be apart of one of the ‚Äúfirsts‚Äù to have the opportunity to receive it
0/0	I work in social care so had my first Pfizer jab yesterday and feel worse than I did going into septic shock with a massive infection throughout my whole abdomen a few years ago. I don't think I'll go back for the 2nd.

1/1	I would get it tomorrow if I could but I‚Äôm deathly terrified of needles
1/1	I would get it.
1/1	I would get the vaccine if I could. I‚Äôm a healthcare worker but I‚Äôm immune compromised so I can‚Äôt
1/1	I would get the vaccine so I can hug my grandparents again.
1/1	I would go get one and pay for it out my own pocket right now if it meant I could get a covid passport and increase my chances of getting out of this country as quickly as possible
1	I would have no problem with a vaccine booster every 3 months if it makes this go away
1/1	I would just like to be able to get the vaccine. It will take forever to vaccinate people at the rate. It is pathetic how this is being done.
1/1	I would like to extend my personal thanks to all the scientific and medical staff who have worked so tirelessly throughout this whole damn thing. We are no there yet but these vaccine trials look very promising.
1/1	I would like to get a vaccine that is safe and very effective
1/1	I would like to thank the healthcare providers in Green Bay for being so proactive in getting the vaccine out. You are doing an amazing job and it is appreciated!
1/1	I would much rather take the risk of getting the vaccine than catching covid and dying or passing it to my loved ones.
0/0	I would need more answers before I decided to get the vaccine.
0/0	I would never trust anything developed under an administration who sees lies as truth and incompetence as the normal state of operation.
1/1	I would never vaccinate my children. Its irresponsible and dangerous. Instead, i take them to a doctor who is properly equipped to do this.
0/0	I would not get one. I choose to take care of my health by taking probiotcs, various supplments Vit D, I eat whole foods and exercise. I wear a mask to shop and stick close to home. No vaccine here!
1/1	I would not hesitate for a moment when my turn comes up to get vaccinated and to have my family vaccinated
0/0	I would not see myself as a man if I put the vaccine in my childrens body
0/0	I would not take it. They fast tracked it and bypassed many testing. In the UK, they have already found people are having reactions to it.
0	I would not trust anything the company says about the vaccine reactions.. they will cover it as not them!
0/0	I would rather die of Covid 19 than take the vaccine Keep that vaccine to yourselves
0/0	I would rather die of natural causes than take some poison
0/0	I would rather get the virus than the vaccine.
0/0	I would rather get the virus.
1/1	I would rather have a child with autism than a child who dies of measles or polio
0/0	I would rather have covid and take my chances with the 0.07 percent of making me ill
1/1	I would rather have side effects from the vaccine than Covid I felt like l had won the lottery last Sunday when l received my 1st Pfizer vaccine. I may of had a sore arm and felt tired for a few days, but when you've been shielding due to being extremely vulnerable it's nothing!
0/0	I would rather take my chances with covid and my Maker than the vaccine.
0/0	I would refuse to take the Coronovirus vaccine if it has the Microchip and Nanobots in it. These would control you and make you docile. Wake up forks.
1/1	I would roll my sleeve up for the vaccine today if it were available.
0/0	I would stay away from this shot as it will reprogram you cells and your body will create a protein very similar to that in the covid19. Your body will constantly make it and you can never detox this out of your system like regular vaccines. So in the future, when your body comes across another coronavirus like a cold or a mutated strain of covid, your body will not see it as an intruder in your system and will not create antibodies to fight it. All of the animals, in the short amount of testing they've done on them, have died. so they suspended testing on animals and went straight to humans.
1/1	I would take it. It will be a year since I saw my family and uk friends soon. I need to travel. No idea what the situation will be for ex pats like me? Do we get offered a vaccine here or do I have to go back to the uk to get one and put myself at risk in the process?
1/1	I would take the COVID vaccine and I would do it as soon as possible. Reason is that the virus is picking up mutations and the efficacy against new variants maybe reduced. The vaccine will have to be modified and if you miss this round you may have to wait a while.
1/1	I would take the vaccine, even with all the conspiracy stories I hear about with how ‚Äúfake‚Äù the virus is and how the vaccine just wants to ‚Äúpatent‚Äù our DNA.
0/-1	I would wait until some studies of the long term effects it can have.
1/1	I would, too, to get vaccinated; however, here in Southern California our doctor‚Äôs office doesn‚Äôt have the vaccine, the pharmacy don‚Äôt have the vaccine and trying to get an appointment with LA county health department takes hours and then once you have the appointment and wait in line for hours they run out! So yeah cheer all you want about how easy and painless it is while the rest of us wait and wait and wait.
0/0/0/0	I wouldn't be so skeptical but bill gates is involved in the vaccine. He is banned for putting birth control in vaccines in Africa. He gave talks a month before the By virus came out saying next pandemic will be a corona virus....just too coincidental. He is also on tape talking about population control-!
0/0	I wouldn't get this vaccine no way done in 8 months!!! MUMPS TOOK 4YRS..
0/0	I wouldn't give this vaccine to my dog never mind me.
0/-1	I wouldn't say it's "safe", all biological therapies carries a risk, and that's the first thing they should know. The thing is, covid vaccine is rushed asf.
0/0	I wouldn't take a vaccine that hasn't been authorized by the NHS.
0/0/0/0	I wouldn't take any vaccine or any medication that was exempt from Criminal litigation as a result of damage to the recipient.

0/1	I'LL PASS CRAZY DUDE
1/1	I'd absolutely get it. I just finished chemo last month and live in a COVID hotspot.
0/0	I'd be dead before I take that vaccine. Actually, I'd not even let my corpse take it.
1/1	I'd bet the correlation between the vaccine skeptics and financial inadequacy is through the roof for any given cohort of people. In short, the stupidest portion of any group of people are the ones most skeptical of the vaccines.
1/1	I'd definitly recommend it if you have access to corona vaccine!

0/0	I'll refuse this so-called vaccine. Make it optional, not mandatory, but we know what's gonna happen.

1/1	I'll take this vaccine if I can stop wearing a mask!!!
0/1/0/0	I'll think about taking it in 18months time once they've finished beta testing it on those that have unshakable trust in hastily made medicine. Good luck! And thank you for being our guinea pigs.

0/0	I'll wait until its proven thanks, right now it's not doing anything
0	I'll wait. thx for the explanation though.
1/-1	I'm "almost" ready to get this vaccine, however, I have a question that I'm hoping you can answer. If our own cells are making the spike protein - which causes the body to attack - isn't that be definition an autoimmune response? How are we going to prevent this vaccine from causing autoimmune response, i.e., the body attacking our own cells (which are making this spike protein)?
1/1	I'm 19. I just received my first Pfizer Vaccine, second coming in two weeks
1/1	I'm 21 and when the vaccines arrived at the beginning I just went to the clinic without an appointment and got my shots. I havent experienced any side effects.
1/1	I'm 26 and I still feel tired and out of breath everyday, this a few months after I got covid. Not saying what you're saying isn't true, but I don't wish that on anyone so everyone please get the vaccine and stay healthy!
1/1	I'm 28 and healthy and got my first dose yesterday! I work with the public though. My arm is very sore but I'm so relieved.
0/0	I'm 50 with fair health. I'll take my chances with the virus. Its fear porn. No, I will not take the vaccine. Even if its mandated. I'll order my food and stay home. I have done it 9 months. What is another year.
1/1	I'm 66 years in USA, I was required by law, as a child to have every vaccination of value for young children. Then I was vaccinated the hell out of when I joined the US Navy in boot camp. I've had tetanus shots, pneumonia shots, shingles, flu shots the last 10 years. I'm as perfectly healthy and more so than others my age or even younger. So,,, F you, you anti-vaccination aholes! Stop being dicks!
1/1	I'm 70 tomorrow (Wednesday) & get my jag on Thursday. Everyone I speak to, whether in the city or in rural Ayrshire, very impressed with the whole vaccination process.
1/1	I'm 71 disabled housebound, got asthma, COPD and sleep apnea and i am terrified that I will die before I get vaccinated....are you
0/0	I'm NEVER going to get the vaccine because I'm vaccine injured and also have allergies.

0/0	I'm THE only person that decides what goes into my body.
0	I'm Very Lucky. My Creator gave Me a Damn Good Immune System. Sorry about Your problem
0/0	I'm a bit concerned about a new company pushing a new treatment as quick as possible. I think it would be best to not immediately use this on a massive scale until years of treatments have been studied.
1/1	I'm a first responder and I can't wait for the vaccine.
1/1	I'm a first responder and our department is submitting the number of vaccine doses we need on this Friday, so hopefully we"ll be getting them next week, but it may be a but longer. I'm super ready and excited to be getting the vaccinated.
1/1	I'm a healthcare worker and I have my appointment to get it on Friday! I'm so excited.
1/1	I'm a little worried about long term side effects as it's a new vaccine but as a healthcare worker I trust the science and I'll probably be first in line anyway.
1/1	I'm a med student starting my clinical rotations in January. I'm waiting on absolute tenterhooks for that needle!!
1/1	I'm a nurse and I'm getting my first dose of Moderna tomorrow.
1/1	I'm a nurse and I'm getting my first dose of Moderna tomorrow...I'm a little nervous, simply because the flu shot usually causes me fatigue and joint pain and I just hate feeling poorly. Hopefully side effects won't be severe.
0/-1	I'm a nurse and no solution in needle and no aspiration of barrel .what is going on??? trickery!!!we don't fall for this mess!!!!
1/1	I'm a pro-vaxxer!

1/1	I'm a republican but I believe in the science of modern medicine and I have faith in the science behind the physiology of the human body as well as the science behind the vaccine anti vaxers are just plain stupid ;\
1/1	I'm a teacher and just made an appointment for my first corona vaccine!
1/1	I'm about to take the vaccine
0/-1	I'm afraid people have more sense than they think
1/1	I'm all for the vacine.
1/1	I'm all for vaccines
1/1	I'm allergic to eggs and I finally this year was able to find someone who'd give me a flu shot. I felt a little flushed for a few minutes afterwards, but that's it. Much less than the side effect my family suffered of having to put up with me for another year.
1/1	I'm also getting the vaccine and recommend everybody who can get it to get it, including my parents.
0/0	I'm also not taking the vaccine, we've had many deadly diseases which still doesn't have vaccine
0/0	I'm anti government, anti system, anti a lot of things, not anti vax. But in this particular case, i'm not taking the vaccine. I don't want things to go "back to normal". I want things to become better. So this is my form of protest kind of (i'm in Germany)
1/1	I'm anti-seatbelt because I can still die or be injured in a car accident.
1/0	I'm as pro-vaccination as they come, but I don't think there's ever been a vaccine so rushed as the one for Covid-19, if anything it feels more like a sort of arms race to who can develop a functional vaccine the quickest. Obviously I get why it's being rushed in the first place, but I am REALLY not going to rush to be the first one to get it.
0/0	I'm boosting my immune system naturally by taking vitamin D and eating healthy i wont be taking a rushed vaccine
1/1	I'm conservative and my wife is on dialysis in a center with people from nursing homes. They asked her if she wanted the vaccine. Shes pretty scared about it because it's new and shes worried about future kidney transplants. I've seen what fellow Republicans say about the pandemic and vaccine, but I've also seen what they have said about January 6th. I told her to get the vaccine....
1/1	I'm curious to know if you feel that there has been enough time to pass to see if there are any long term side effects to the Covid 19 vaccine. it doesn't seem to me that enough time has passed to really find out if there are any side effects. But I'm all for the vaccine, especially if it will save millions of lives.
1/1	I'm definitely more scared of covid and would do it yearly if I had to.
0/0	I'm definitely not taking it...warp speed my ass
0/0	I'm definitely not taking this vaccine. It's scary.
1/1	I'm definitely taking it
1/1	I'm extremely excited and hoping to get it soon
1/0	I'm fine with it. More vaccine for those who need it.
1/1	I'm from Moscow, Russia. I vaccinated last weak. I' m feeling fine and so are my friends. I believe that vaccination is the best thing to do in this case. Wish you all good health!!!!!
0/0	I'm from the UK and I'm not getting the shot either heard that 30 people died from one of them.
1/1	I'm front line, still waiting
1/1	I'm genuinely happy that the vaccines are gradually coming out so that all the health-care workers can be protected as they are sacrificing their lives and well-being to fight this disease.
1/1	I'm getting a vaccine shot soon who else is getting it soon

1/-1	I'm getting the second dose tomorrow.
1/1	I'm getting the vaccine when it comes available
1/1	I'm getting this one, I rather not trust the tinfoil on the internet
0/0	I'm glad I have enough sense not to get the vaccine. Pray hard, eat right, wash your hands, wear a mask and keep it moving.
1/1	I'm glad I'm not the only one! I just turned 30 and volunteer at a nursing home and received the vaccine. Onward to herd immunity!
1/1	I'm glad I've already received both doses. I'm doing my part to end this pandemic.
0/0	I'm glad that my refusal to be vaccinated bothers you.....it warms my unvaccinated little heart.
1/1	I'm glad that this pandemic finally ends. I wanna get the vaccine as soon as possible.
1/1	I'm glad there are so many antivaxxers, it means more vaccine for me
0/0	I'm glad there is so many people who believe this is full of BS cause I'm not getting the vaccine and people think I'm crazy. I never got the flu shot either and I didn't get sick. I have worked through covid and still see my family and friends. I'm not sick and they are not sick either. This is all about control and take away freedom and oppress people into slaves. Just one woman's opinion.
1/1	I'm glad there's a vaccine. Once people get the vaccine I want the mask wearing to end. Biggest lesson learned is don't let sick people in our country.
1/1	I'm going to be joining the Johnson & Johnson trial next week so hopefully that one works too
0/0	I'm going to not get it, but lie and say that I got it.
1/1	I'm going to take it. I just want myself and family to be safe and alive, all that matters at this point.
1/1	I'm going to take it...its the prophesy coming tru this vaccine is the mark of the beast!
1/1	I'm going to wait to hear which vaccine the medcram guy ends up taking and then I'll take the same one.
1/1	I'm gonna get the vaccine to protect the people around me.
1/1	I'm gonna vaccine myself
0/0	I'm good y'all can skip me on that vaccine.
0/0	I'm good. You can have my covid vaccine along with my flu vaccine
0/0	I'm good... Kick me off that list please. hmu again in 5-10 years and then start from the beginning and try to convince me to take it but for now... Hard pass.
0/0	I'm guessing this has more to do with vaccines being rushed than anything else. I remember feeling the same way about the talks of early vaccines because I didn't think they'd be testing enough
1/1	I'm happy for the people who don't want the jab. It means the rest of us move up the queue faster.
1/1	I'm happy that people are really trying so hard to save our lives and we are really thankful for this amazing news may we all be healthy and safe
1/1	I'm happy to report that I received my second dose of the Moderna vaccine last Wednesday and I only had one day of feeling a bit crummy. All is well and I am now up-to-date on my vaccinations. ‚Å£

1/1	I'm in England and had my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine this morning.
0/0	I'm in Healthcare and will not take the vaccine!
0/0	I'm in Oregon, I refuse to have the vaccine. You Californians have my full support if you don't want to have it either! ü§úü§õ
1	I'm in a high risk group and signed up to get the vaccine ASAP. I'm happy to take it. One thing that makes me angry is that at least in some jurisdictions, folks jump the line with claims that aren't true. "I am a daycare worker." (person is retired, watches grandchild once a week.) It just really gets to me. There are people who risk their lives, and you're jumping the line? ... .. yeah no I will not talk to you again.
1/1	I'm in favor of taking the vax
0/0	I'm in no particular hurry
1/1	I'm in the same boat as you. But im not selfish so I'm going to trust the experts on this one so I may not spread this virus.
1/1	I'm israeli, and 16 yo, I got the vaccine two days ago, I'm feeling great.
1/-1	I'm just here to learn from all the internet WebMD experts
1/1	I'm just so glad that back in the 1950s my mother and 99.9% of her peers followed medical advice and vaccinated us kids rather than thinking they knew better. I could have been dead from smallpox by now if my mother had only had a "friend" who knew so much more than her doctor.
0/0	I'm just waiting for this to turn into a Zombie apocalypse.
1/1	I'm just waiting, waiting for that anti-coronavirus vaccine movement to come about in reaction to it finally becoming available for average people.
0/0	I'm just worried about the long term effects
1/1	I'm looking forward to getting my Covid vaccine next week. I'll happily wear a mask and social distance until we reach herd immunity.
1/1	I'm looking forward to getting my vaccination as soon as possible.
1/1	I'm looking forward to getting the COVID-19 vaccine too I have asthma, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure. I have a flu shot ever year I'm also in my mid 60's
1/1	I'm looking forward to getting vaccinated in hopefully a few months time. The more antivaxers that refuse to take it, the faster the roll out to everyone else.
0/0	I'm low risk, physically and mentally fit. Someone else can have my doses.
0/0	I'm low risk. physically and mentally fit. Someone else can have my doses.
1/1	I'm more scared of covid than of any potential vaccine side effects!
0/0	I'm more than willing to wear the mask. year round, but not your VACCINE! I'M A OKAY!
0/0	I'm never taking the vaccine. Your body, your choice people.
0/0	I'm no anti-vaxer, but it's probably safer to take the vaccine after a while, let others go first and see if the vaccine is safe or not. The vaccine seems to be quite rushed, I'll be waiting until its proven safe.
0/0	I'm normal now.. I won't be having any expermenat DNA altering jab.
0/0	I'm not Anti-Vax but I do not trust this vaccine and would prefer to wait a few before taking it. I don't trust this vaccine at all.
0/0	I'm not a fan of vaccines in general, don't get the flu shot and don't plan on receiving any COVID-19 vaccine. Especially after viewing the video interview with Jorge Araujo, former Merck chemist
0/0	I'm not a lab rat.. I will wait till the current rats have thinned out or not. So far plenty are dropping down.
0	I'm not a lab rat.. I will wait till the current rats have thinned out or not. So far plenty are dropping down.¬†(y)¬†great stuff. If 1 death out of 10.000 infected is enough to stop the world, wouldn't 1 death out of 10.000 vaccinated be enough to stop the program? Guess not..
1/1	I'm not a risk patient for the flu, but I still get my flu shot because having the flu, even if I have a fairly good immunity, sucks cock and I hate it.
1/-1	I'm not afraid of COVID. I am more worried about going crazy and losing my from being in quarantine and not able to go anywhere!
0/0	I'm not against the vaccine for those who believe in them.. but for me it's a big No.
0/0	I'm not against vaccines, but the mRNA vaccines have only had very limited testing, and if excess respiratory deaths are within normal for the year, there simply is no health emergency to justify mass vaccination with an experimental drug.
0/0	I'm not an anti vaxxer, but I do have reservations about being injected with something that's been quite rushed.
0/0	I'm not an anti-vax person. I'm also not an anti-common sense person! I'm concerned about the way that these vaccines were rushed to market in less than a year. The vaccine approval process usually takes 5-15 years! I'll wait & see.
0/0	I'm not an anti-vaxxer but a vaccine developed in 6-12 months is giving me doubts.
0/0	I'm not an anti-vaxxer but a vaccine developed in 6-12months is giving me doubts
0/0	I'm not anti vax. I get the flue vaccine every year, but I just don't trust two things about the new COVID Vaccines. 1. I don't have trust in the long term safety of the new mRna vaccines. 2. The speed they were developed doesn't inspire confidence in their safety. I will probably wait until the Novavax or the GSK vaccines are approved since they use traditional methodology in their production.
0/0	I'm not anti-vac but I'm not taking a vaccine with 99.7% survival rate while also the fact I probably already had the virus
0/0	I'm not anti-vaccine, I'm anti-this vaccine.
0/0	I'm not anti-vaccine, just anti THIS vaccine that has been rushed and not tested properly
0/0/0/0/0	I'm not anti-vaccine, just anti THIS vaccine that has been rushed and not tested properly. For all we know it might be a polio 2.0
0	I'm not anti-vax, I'm anti-ruining my health for sure just because of a chance of getting something else ruining my health. And I've had the flu. It was bad. But that is the chance I have to take so I'm not crippled with disabling arthritis and severe plaque psoriasis all over my body instead of just my scalp
0/1	I'm not antivax but I'm concerned about ingredients as I am in everything I put in my body. Because in the past they say oh this ingredient is safe and then years later, oh this product causes cancer and if you or a loved one have been hurt by one you may be compensated.

1/1	I'm not in a hurry to take it, but I'll take it.
0/0	I'm not interested in how you feel now, I'm interested in how you are after 2-10 years with the vaccine in your body

0/0	I'm not willing to have those side effects!
0/0	I'm not willing to take something that has not been tested for side effects in people with cancer HIV and pneumonia COPD or other health issues for that matter, this is a vaccine that is rushed and I do not trust it how do we get a pandemic and a vaccine is made quickly mean while we have children and others dying of cancer 4 more then a hundred years and still can't find a vaccine or a cure kind of makes me sick
0/0	I'm nothing like an anti-vaxxer! I just think that all the experts are wrong, this "treatment" is a danger to children and must be banned, all the experts are probably in on a big conspiracy, they've not tested it for long enough anyway, have you read this blog?
1/1	I'm part of one of the trial groups. Heading to the right direction for everyone! It'll be a few months but there is a light at the end of the tunnel.
1/1	I'm partially vaccinated, getting my 2nd one in a few weeks. It was really cool to experience the vaccine clinic, definitely felt Iike history in the making.
1/1/1	I'm planning getting vaccinated for Covid, but can you take benadryl aftermath?
1/1	I'm pleased to note how many people are NOW saying they'll have the vaccine when its offered
1/1	I'm pretty good at examining potential consequences, and really the only thing outside of normal immune reaction side effects I can think is an excessive inflammatory reaction related to the delivery mechanism.
0/0	I'm pretty relaxed about this; as an under-50 year old in the private sector with with no underlying health conditions, by the time the NHS gets round to even offering me a vaccine, there will be over a year (probably longer) of real world testing on healthcare workers, the elderly and infirm. If there are unwanted side effects I'll know all about them long before I have to make a choice about getting the vaccine.
0/0	I'm pretty sure vaccine isn't the correct term, its actually gene therapy
0/0	I'm pretty sure vaccine isn't the correct term, its actually gene therapy.
1/1	I'm pro vaccine and every covid safe measure. But this is a unique virus and set of circumstances Australia finds itself in. I just hope we don't inadvertently makes things worse here, because compared to the rest of the world, we are doing very well
1/1	I'm pro vaccine because Covid is high risk for some ( likely much higher than vaccine) but I don't pretend to know something that can't possibly be proven at this point
1/1	I'm pro vaccine but I would never "punish" someone for decisions others make about their own bodies.
1/1	I'm pro vaccine but I wouldn't force it on people, it should remain an individual choice.
1/1	I'm pro vaccine, I hope as many people as possible get vaccinated, but it's a particularly British thing that the more we're told we must do something the more resistance we put up.
0/0	I'm pro vaccine, but not when it comes to experimental vaccines like these.
1/1	I'm pro vax, I have had a flu jab every year. As part of duty of care in my job, I don't mind. My choice. I'm also pro choice, if you don't want it. No way should you have it. But don't call me stupid, if I don't agree with your choice.. Its my choice..
0/1	I'm quitting my job if they require me to take it.
1/1	I'm ready for the pandemic to be over.
1/1	I'm ready to be injected now!
0/0	I'm ready to quit the moment my employer says I have to take a vaccine
0/0	I'm ready to quit the moment my employer says I have to take a vaccine.
0/0/0/0	I'm ready to quit the moment my employer says I have to take a vaccine. This goes way way deeper than most people would ever think possible.
1/1	I'm ready...... let's get this party started
1/1	I'm really glad that you had the opportunity to get your shots!!
0/0	I'm refusing the vax.
0/0	I'm running a vaccine trial with myself as the guinea-pig .... Good food, vitamin D, sleep and social distancing. So far it's 100% effective.
0/0	I'm scared of the sideeffects
1/1/1/1	I'm scheduled to be vaccinated on thursday. I work in a covid unit and see the devastation of this virus, so I'm really excited it's finally here. I've been keeping up with the science because, like anyone, I don't want to roll up my sleeve to something that isn't safe. I feel confident in this vaccine. mRNA vaccines have been studied for over a decade. The reason this one was developed quickly is because the whole world was throwing money at this project. It's amazing what can be accomplished with such a huge collective effort. Roll up those sleeves, America. Let's save a life and get back to something more normal.
1/1	I'm scheduled to get 1st dose this week. Pfizer vaccine.
0/0	I'm seriously asking. not attempting to be an a$$hole. But why did you get it in the first place? Again. this question is sincere. Thanks
1/1	I'm shocked of the people in this world, there is so many who belive in lies. This is a normal vaccine as all the others out there are
1/1	I'm signed up for my first vaccine dose on Monday (I work at the hospital) and I was a little nervous. I feel a lot more prepared now!
1/1	I'm so envious that you have the COVID Vaccine! Here in Australia we haven't gained access to it yet, here's hoping it is soon
1/1	I'm so glad my mom wasn't huge on the internet when I was a baby, she told me the other day "if I knew what I know now, I wouldn't have vaccinated you" and I just stared at her for a couple seconds
1/1	I'm so glad you all could get vaccinated and that it's providing such good protection vs. COVID.
1	I'm so happy - my mother-in-law in LTC received her first vaccine shot yesterday. You have no idea what a relief it is, we've been petrified for almost a year. Every phone call would send the heart racing.
0/0	I'm so happy that my grandparents don't wanna take it. BIG NO.!
1/1	I'm so happy, I love seeing people say yes to science
1/1	I'm so proud to be a part of this trial! üí™üèº How wonderful to hopefully have another vaccine rolling out soon!
0/0	I'm so sketchy on this vaccine.. My moms uncle apparently got vaccinated and was found dead a couple days later from a "fall". He was perfectly healthy and had zero troubles walking. Idk man
0/0/0/0	I'm so sorry for the families shattered by vaccine injuries. Thank you to these families who share their heartbreaks. You are saving so many lives!!!! Please people wake up.
1/1	I'm soooo looking forward to my vaccination in a few months!
0/0	I'm sorry POTUS fell for this, it looks like pure welfare for big pharma. There is NO way they could suddenly come up with a Corona virus vaccine in months when they've tried unsuccessfully for decades. I think it's a scam.
1/-1	I'm sorry to be critical but I don't think the J&J vaccine is a good idea in places where the mRNA vaccines are an option. Preventing serious illness is all well and good for the vaccinated person, but if you're still able to become infected and transmit the virus, then everyone else around you continues to be borked. Better to have the vaccine that appears to prevent infection and transmission than the one that saves just the transmitter from serious symptoms.
0/0	I'm still not getting it.
0/0	I'm still not taking it and I don't care what clergy member does it's not going to change my mind.
1/1	I'm super curious to see how people respond to it, especially folks who have autoimmune conditions but aren't immunocompromised. (Context: I fall in that camp myself and have pretty stressful reactions to vaccines usually so I tend to only get certain ones. For folks like me, it'll be helpful to see how it seems to go for other atypical folks.)
1/1	I'm sure that will be the only one my insurance will cover...
0/0	I'm sure there will be a many more vaccine horror stories.
0/-1	I'm surprised YouTube allowed this video, oh its bs no wonder
1/1	I'm taking it
1/1	I'm tearing up that this is finally coming. It's been such a tough last 9 months here in the rural midwest where the majority of people don't take things seriously and then people die. Hopefully this is a sign that we're almost at the end.
0/0	I'm too allergic to medications and vaccines. I'm not afraid of getting Covid and won't be getting it. My surgeon who was doing my foot surgery had his second dose and had to be hospitalized. Nope
0/0	I'm trying to get medical treatment in the Philadelphia area and they refuse to treat me until I take the vaccine I told them forget it then
1/1	I'm unaware of any anti vaxxers I know IRL, I am however aware of people who do not want to get the covid vaccine, though I think they have been coming around on it lately.
1/1	I'm waiting my turn with optimism.
0/0	I'm willing to donate my dose since I won't be using it.
0/0	I'm with you. Somebody else can have mine.
1	I'm working on the shot!
0/0	I'm writing today also, but with this: Covid 19 vaccines are, by their own description, experimental. They are intended for the whole planet. Experiments go right, experiments go wrong. If this goes wrong, it wipes out the human race. How can any reasonable person support that?
0/0	I'm young, healthy, don't ever get sick and have never had a flu or any kind of virus other than the odd stomach bug.
1/1/1	I'ma take it
1/1	I've been saying this for months. There's likely a bias in all these polls that leads to anti-vaxxers being more likely to respond to them.
0/0/0/0	I've been surrounded by people with Covid & I have not yet got it. Meaning I'm immune... Why the hell would I want this type of vaccine.
0/0	I've got a question. Couldn't there be side effects that only appear in a few years? That's the only thing I'm sceptical about, but I'm no expert and I'd love to see an explanation to how safe it is and how you can guarantee me that I won't have some weird disease in a few years
1/1	I've gotten the Moderna vaccine, I had very mild side effects, even more mild than my normal Influenza vaccine. I go back for my second dose on the 8th of February!
1/1	I've gotten the first one & have an appointment for the second on 2/19. No reaction except a slight headache to the first shot. I can't imagine not getting a vaccine against a lethal virus by which 473,182 people in the US have died in 11 months. None of them expected death
1/1	I've had both my vaccinations. No effects after 1st one. Fatigued for a day or 2 after the 2nd with a mild headache. My dad died from covid last November. He died fighting for his breath in hospital. The vaccine came too late for him. I cannot understand anyone refusing.
1/1	I've had both of my vaccines and I really didn't have much of a reaction at all. Sore arm with the first shot and maybe a little tired with the second...that's it.
1/-1	I've had mine and been fine.
1/1	I've had my 1st jab the side effects are horrible, feelings of happiness, getting my life back, the country at last coming out of this dark shadow hanging over it to name a few can't wait to get my 2nd might even go on holiday again and smile
1	I've had my first one today, no side effects so far lets face it, there is side effects to a lot of medications/vaccines. It has to be worth it if it gets rid of this Covid!
1/1	I've had my vaccine.. thank fuk..
0/1	I've heard all kinds of things. It can give you aids. It's made with animal genetics and can change your dna and make you animal like. The government is just putting microchips in you. And the people who told me this 100% believe this and have read this online from people who have "researched" this and are "reputable".
1/0	I've just had a terrible side effect to the #OxfordVaccine #CovidVaccine I've come out with a degree!
0/1	I've just had my 2nd dose of the vaccine today at lunchtime unexpectedly, extra clinic put on as more Pfizer available to health care staff. Absolutely ecstatic to have had it. Again absolute no pain and feel fantastic x
1/-1	I've just missed going outside and see people in peace
0/0	I've never been against vaccinations in my life but I'm not trusting anything that's been rushed to production; especially not if it's coming out of Russia, China or the US
0/0	I've never been against vaccinations in my life but I'm not trusting anything that's been rushed to production; especially not if it's coming out of Russia, China or the US.
1/1	I've never had issues/bad side effects from vaccines so I've got no reason not to. Just like I've had the flu shot every year of my working life (because working in courthouses is pretty high risk for flu).
1/1	I've read the info and believe in science, and I believed these vaccines were safe and effective basically for a while now. But this news... As someone who's parents are very high risk, it really confirms it for me. It gives me so much hope that they'll be safe once they receive their two doses. I feel more relief now than I did when I received my own doses.
1/1	I've received both shots of the vaccine from Moderna because of my first responder job. I can tell you from my experience that everyone's reaction to the vaccine will differ from person to person. The first shot only gave me a sore shoulder for about a day or so. The second shot I got I ended up getting a mild case of the flu. But some of my co-workers had gotten worst reactions from the first shot and mild reactions from the second shot.
0/0	I've reported this as terrorism. Government using the threat of violence to create fear.
0/0	I've said America is doomed. America will never be the same again. Millions have been sold out. Biden will push trumps vax on everyone
1/1	I've said some things on YouTube that I've come to regret to be honest I don't think vaccines are bad but I do think people should have a choice whether to take them or not if they want to experience the virus or not is up to them and if they don't believe in vaccines that's fine everyone is entitled to their own opinion so in my opinion people shouldn't be forced to get the coronavirus vaccine
0/0/0	I've seen enough. It's a strong no for me. If you still think it's safe, please search a bit more, you clearly still have no idea..
1/1	I've seen old, terminally ill people get the covid vaccine and not have any symptoms besides a sore arm. I, for one, am not worried.
0/0	I've survived 10 months of being exposed to 10,000 people a day. I have no need for a vaccine now. You can keep it. as for employer mandates...not a difficult decision - employers are replaceable, my life is not.
0/0	I, a New York citizen, Stand in total agreement with the Californians! üíØ% No poison for me! üôÖüèæ‚ôÄ
1/1	I, along with many of my work colleagues working on the AstraZeneca vaccine, received my first dose of the COVID inoculation. It was a wonderful
1/1	I, and others, know that vaccination will be the only way to save ourselves and our loved ones. Only damned fools deny it.
0/0	I, nor my family will take the Covid shot--ever!
1/-1	I,ll take my chances with the vax ,thank.
1/0	I,m just worried if its safe or not. They keep saying it is, but how do they know not being anywhere near the TWO YEARS it usually takes to get a vaccine. Short cuts are needed for under TWO years, I will be happy to take it Sept 2022 subject to those taking it now still being functional & producing normal children.
1/1	I- Wow the comments! Seriously I'm actually writing a paper debunking anti-vaxxers, any and all anti-vaxxers please give me REAL reasons why they are so bad

1/1	If AIDS spreads quicker like this, you guys will also have a vaccine of it in a year I bet.
1/0	If COVID was like the flu i wouldn‚Äôt even bother to get the vaccine but this shit different.
1/1	If FDA approved I'll take the vaccine ASAP!! I be Damn if I catch covid-19 üíØüí™üèæ
1/1	If I can dumb it down that much, I don‚Äôt know why people have to be so scared of it.
1/1/1	If I can get a one shot in any of the months in spring, I will be more then pleased
1/1	If I can't get the virus, I can't spread it that's why I want to be immune.
0/0	If I can't hold someone accountable for a product that can hurt me then I don't have to take it period dot.
0/0	If I can't sue the company, that's a rap itself.
1/1	If I could, I would have taken the phase 3 trials. I'd be the first in whatever line for the vaccine.
1/0	If I go outside I will get autism so I don't do it
1/1	If I had parents at a nursing home and a nursing home worker working there refused vaccination I would want the nursing home to let that employee go immediately.
1/1	If I have kids when I'm older, and they say that they are against vaccines, I'll tell them about the time we are in right now.
0/0	If I look up and see vaccine companies STOPPING vaccinations because there is not enough.¬† I will say THAT IS BACKWARDS!¬† If you dont have enough you dont need to stop using the ones you have.¬† Thats a lie.¬† MOST people dont want it!¬† They are closing a lot of centers, this makes the small percent of people that do want it have to wait in LONG LINES.....This increases interest. ¬† Just like buying a tickle me elmo, or any other product.¬† To ME they are stopping for one real reason.¬† So they can get as many people to take it at ONCE.¬† No time to have enough people show the results. ¬† People are already being silenced.¬† Once they get it down, the left will be next.¬† They can already have 50% of the country tagged as againtst it and censor people in a literal second.
0/0	If I needed a reason not to take the vaccine this was it
1/1	If I read the research on the vaccine and I thought it was sound, I would take it.
0/0	If I were you, I'd think before doing something so rash
1/0	If I'm about to be locked in a cell full of other people with coronavirus and not much medical care, then yes, please give me an untested vaccine first.
1/0	If I'm being honest, "vaccine doubters among the staff" of a medical facility kind of terrifies me.
1/1	If They Are An Intelligent And Rational Person They Will Take It.
0/-1	If a Politian had to choose between one vaccine and one placebo on a table they would walk away.
0/0	If a company has been granted immunity against any lawsuits in the future for any possible long term side effects of the vaccine then eh... count me out!
0/0	If a vaccine injuries you or kills you the company who makes that vaccine are not responsible and are not liable. There is no guarantee that you will not get coronavirus or spread it after getting a vaccine
0/0	If a vaccine injuries you or kills you the company who makes that vaccine are not responsible and are not liable. There is no guarantee that you will not get coronavirus or spread it after getting a vaccine. The vaccine is also made with aborted fetal tissue. And for all of these reasons I will never receive a coronavirus vaccine ever.
1/0	If a vaccine works with your immune system, why give it to someone who has a poor immune system, as is being suggested ?
0/0	If a whole country decided to not wear masks. shutdown. lockdown... what percentage of the population do you think would die in a year? If you said 0%. you are correct. Sweden's All death total increased by 6.994 in 2020. Sweden has a population of 10.380.245. That is a 0.06% population hit in 2020... Thank you for ending the ' ' pandemic ' ' with a monumental case study Sweden!
0/0/0/0	If all the people that want the vaccine take it and they are "safe" then my freedom to deny the vaccine won't hurt you... you're immunized.
0/0	If all the vulnerable are vaccinated, and I being young and healthy are still capable of being infectious even if the vaccine keeps my symptoms down, why do I need vaccinating again?
1/1/1/1	If antivaxxers don‚Äôt take the vaccine, normal people MUST take the vaccine.
0/0/0/0	If anybody out there truly cares for there kids please wonder what the hell is in that needle
1/0	If anyone takes this gene therapy. Then you are absolutely crazy or scared to death because you have watched too much mainstream. Cv19 does not pass koch's postulates therefore never proven to exist. Exosomes are really viruses. The pcr test has been manipulated and can find anything in anybody given enough cycles. Says Kary Mullis the creator... Full armour
0/-1	If anything happens, the scout corps are ready. Dont worry
0/0	If distancing worked why masks? If masks worked why distancing? If both worked why lockdowns? If kockdowns worked why vaccines? If vaccines work why vaxx manufacturers are exempt from responsibility?
0/0	If enough sheeple get the vaccine then that means I won't have to.
0/0	If everyone around me has had the vaccine they will all be immune, which means I cannot catch the lurgy from them so I won't need to have the vaccine myself √∞≈∏Àú≈†
1/-1	If everything goes well, there might be an effective vaccine in less than 18 months‚Äîthe fastest a vaccine has ever been developed. That will depend on decisions we make today, including the federal government investing in building up manufacturing capacity.
0	If i had to choose between covid & the vaccine, covid her I come baby
0/0/0/0/0	If immunity lasts few months after a covid illness, how do we know that an individual's immunity after this vaccine will sustain longer?
1/1	If it comes to my country I will take it gratefully. Without a second thought
1/-1	If it gets bad in the winter, think of it this way: We had a limited time in the summer to rapidly test vaccines using the many many volunteers for human challenge trials, and we squandered it, but at least some counterfactual worlds out there are doing great!
1/1	If it gets the world to near normal what's the issue! I cant wait to get jabbed so I can play my part in helping my industry back to work. Too many good people in the entertainment industry struggling at the moment.
0/0	If it has any aborted fetus tissue at all I'll never touch it regardless of what the pope says. Honestly I'd likely never get it anyway though
0/0	If it is so "safe and effective" why are so many people getting really bad adverse reactions, and why are so many dying after getting the injections??? Also now, the CDC and WHO have agreed that hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin are very effective and safe at curing you from Covid-19.
0/0	If it is tested then would you know in the results that it is safe for upcoming generations if it's effect starting after so many years then how we take it safe today.
1/1	If it keeps you out of hospital and dying its doing well Better than not any vaccine at all...... Some will always use any news to be negative to forward their own petty agenda It's time for all of us to focus on the positives for society as a whole.
1/1/1	If it makes it past FDA with appropriate screening, proper Phase I/II/III trials/metas, then yes.
1/1	If it wasn‚Äôt for the vaccine, I would have been hit hard with Covid! I am glad I have the vaccine!!!
1/1	If it works, who cares where it's from.
0/0	If it's safe, then why can't we sue the manufacturer if we have a severe reaction or vaccine injury
0/0	If it's so safe how come the UK government has had to give Pfizer immunity from being sued, can anyone answer me that, it doesn't look good
0/0	If it's so safe then why does it have a ton of side effects?
0/0	If it's so safe, why does the vaccine injury compensation program exist? Vaccines are poisonous!
1/1	If it‚Äôs 75% effective in stopping the spread AND you have essentially zero chance of severe covid, it will be very useful.
1/1	If it‚Äôs the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine there‚Äôs absolutely zero possibility they got sick from it. Also, both take two doses given two weeks apart for it to be effective. They got infected from someone, most likely one of the people administering the vaccine or employee of the nursing home.
0/0	If mandating vaccines was actually about health...Then why not mandate healthy eating? Why not mandate exercise? Because it's not about health. It's about money, power and control by way of forced medical intervention!!!
0/0	If medical professionals don't trust the vaccine why should I trust it?
1/1	If multiple vaccines become available, I wonder if getting all of them over time might increase your immunity over just one.
1/0	If my doctor a medical professional that most likely researched the science gets the shot then if you trust your doctor with your health then that is my reason for getting it myself.
0/0	If my job requires me to take this vaccine, I will give up my white collar job to go back to blue collar or independent contractor versus putting my life at risk
1	If my nurse was an anti vaxxer, I would rather run out of the hospital than be treated by her.
1/1	If not enough people vaccinate, then there doesn't form an immunity for everyone.
0/1	If not, then another booster shot may be necessary.
0/-1	If one of the side effects of taking this Vaccine is the increase in the size of your manhood. 90% of men and 20% of women would take it. (facts).
1/1	If only some people knew the effects of usual drugs we take n we deem safe they would receive the vaccines without making bogus statements when they know nothing to do with effects of drugs they take n think are safe.... Take the vaccines or leave it who loses
1/1	If people had this same negative energy around the corinvirunus vaccine, with all the other past vaccines. We'd all be dead.
0/0	If people in the health care field have reservations about this vaccine, that's all I need to know. I'd rather take my chances with a virus that has an over 99% survival rate.
1/1/1	If people would just take a totally safe vaccine then we would be so much safer
1/1	If sky say that the vaccine is safe..then I guess it must be.
0/0	If someone dies from taking the vaccine they will blame in on covit 19
0/0	If something is free, you are the product
1/1/1/1/0	If taking the vaccine means I can go back to living my life, sign me up. I‚Äôll take 6.
0/0/0	If that is not enough to get you convinced, nothing will, you are doomed. View the film VAXXED asap. Get on board with the anti-vaccination mouvement before its too late.
0/0	If the AZ vaccine does not work on the over sixty fives, why is the EU still jumping up and down and complaining that they aren't getting enough supplies?
1	If the Americans don't want it, send it to other countries. We'll gladly accept the vaccines
0/0	If the Aust government refuses to set up a safety net for its citizens to take the fast-tracked COVID vaccines, that has proved to be risky with harmful side effects, according to overseas data, then we can refuse to take such vaccines. I consent to nothing! #novax for me!
0/0	If the Economist really wanted to get the Vaccines they would demand that the civil liability shield on the big pharma vaccine producers be removed so that ordinary people can sue when they get severe side effects from their experimental products.
0/1	If the body's immune system is capable of recognizing the virus based on its spike proteins, why would we need to synthetically create them?
0/0	If the government run these vaccination trials like they run border control I think I‚Äôll give it a miss my confidence with both of them is zero
0/0	If the mRNA message disappears so quickly, how does it make enough spike protein to trigger an immune response?
0/0	If the media promotes it, avoid it
0/0	If the people who made the vaccine can't be sued, that should speak for itself
1/1/1	If the top professionals in health care are having it, then it's good enough for me too
0/0	If the vaccine doesn‚Äôt protect 100% , and you can still get the COVID after vaccination, why get it at all? It‚Äôs ridiculous and even dangerous. Nobody knows how our body is going to react with getting the vaccine. It‚Äôs not only bad for allergic people, as for we don‚Äôt know what damage to our body it can cause in the long term. No research can be done in a short term. I‚Äôm concern
0/0	If the vaccine is 95% effective and I already have a 99.99% chance of recovering within 4 days if I get COVID why would I need the vaccine?
1/1	If the vaccine is killing people then we are in serious trouble as most of our front line workers and medical personnel have taken the vaccine. I have had coovid19 and I am still getting the vaccine. I believe that our medical experts would not have mostly gotten the vaccine if it was dangerous. They are much more educated than me and if they feel it is safe for themselves and their family then I will trust their judgement.
1/1	If the vaccine is meets the approval of top immunologists and epidemiologists, then no doubt about it.
0/-1	If the vaccine triggers an immune response than for the people that have had it why do they recommend getting the vaccine?... your body will have built up immunity to Covid .. sounds fishy ! I know many people including health care workers are not getting it
1/1	If there is a vaccine for it, I have it.
0/0	If there is a vaccine there's gonna be side effects that we don't know about
0/0	If there was a deadly virus wiping out humanity then maybe I would consider taking a vaccine but there isn't
1/1	If there's a word for an emotion that combines joy, gratitude, and fatigue, I'm that word today. Finally got vaccine against COVID!!
0/0	If these pharmaceutical corporations are going to protect themselves from litigation in case of injury and or death from their vaccines, I‚Äôll protect myself by not taking it
0/0	If these pharmaceutical corporations are going to protect themselves from litigation in case of injury and or death from their vaccines, I‚Äôll protect myself by not taking it.
0/0	If these vaccines are so safe .. why are the companies producing them given immunity from prosecution when a few years down the line the shtf ?
0/0	If they are "safe and effective" why are the manufacturer's granted legal protection from injuries and death? 'Asking for a friend.'
1/1	If they can do this well, vaccinating enough people would stamp out the disease.
1/1	If they can roll this out fast enough then good. Is it possible to get one of the other vaccines later down the line when they are more available.
1/1	If they don't get vaccinated then don't let them into our countries. Just as those that choose not to be vaccinated in the UK should not be permitted to travel outside of the UK
1/1	If they don't want it and they suffer ill effects of covid, unlucky for them. The vulnerable who could contract it from the unimmunised, should be vaccinated. So, in theory only the sceptics will suffer. They made their choice. Darwinism has gotten us this far :).
1/1	If they don't want it then don't give it to them. When they catch covid don't treat them.
1/1	If they dont want it we ll take it .just please hurry up lol
1/1	If they don‚Äôt want it don‚Äôt take it. stop telling everybody else their views, it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs own choice, I choose yes, my choice.
0/-1	If they offer the Vaccine to me I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll give it to these guys and they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll have extra protection.
0/0/0/0	If they offer the Vaccine to me I‚Äôll give it to these guys and they‚Äôll have extra protection.
1/1	If they offered me a vaccine I would take it
0/0	If they try I will fight back however I have to. I still have medical rights to refuse treatment.
0/0	If they're so safe and effective, why is old Biden still walking around masked everywhere virtual signaling after taking it (a clean one he was given I'm sure, or possibly a saline solution). They can't deny the fact that there are no liability wavers they'll sign in case there are long term effects, and they can't deny there are zero long term studies or tests on their experimental gene therapy. How do these people know that splicing and inserting genes from things like Jellyfish and putting into the human body has no unforeseen consequences. WE DON'T KNOW SHIT. Natural antibodies ftw, that's all you need. ESPECIALLY in regards to a flu-like illness that barely affects 99% of people. Don't forget old unhealthy Trump survived it.
1/1	If they're that stupid not to take the vaccine let them get the virus.
1/1	If this moment doesn‚Äôt symbolize hope for the future of our country, I don‚Äôt know what does. New chapter of healing and progress.
1/1	If this vaccine comes out, I'm gonna be the first in line to get it. It is gonna be as refreshing as waking up from a nightmare
0/1	If this vaccine is so good why is it killing people all over the world
0/0	If this vaccine is ‚Äúso safe‚Äù why do you still have to wear a mask?
0/0	If this were a real pandemic the rich people would be prioritized to get vaccinated first.
1/-1	If too many people are afraid to get the vaccine, it is bad for the world, but I wont have to wait and will be immune. Eventually enough of the early adopters will prove the vaccine safe and others will get on the bandwagon.
1/1	If u dont wanna trust scientists and not take the vaccine, then keep yourself at home to reduce the spread of the virus-- that is if u arent a selfish prick and care about others in it community.
1/1	If vaccine were tewwibl as you say why presidents get vaccinated
0/0/0	If vaccines are safe, why the ‚ÄúZero Liability‚Äù contract
0/0/0/0/0/0	If vaccines are safe, why the ‚ÄúZero Liability‚Äù contract?
0/0/0/0/0	If vaccines are safe, why the ‚ÄúZero Liability‚Äù contract????
0/0	If vaccines are so safe why does the federal government protect big pharma from vaccine injury lawsuits? Today if you are injured by a vaccine you have to file suit with the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program and if you win the US taxpayer pays not Big Pharma!
0/0	If vaccines are so safe, then why do they not have any liability protection? Sounds like they are not that safe according to the manufacturers....Caveat Emptor.
1/1	If vaccines didn‚Äôt work, then why has the polio and measle rate decrease.
1/1	If vaccines were bad the population of the UK would be quite a few million less.
1/1	If we all get the vaccine it won't have any mores hosts and it'll die out, like smallpox and polio.
1/1	If we all get vaccinated, this mess will soon be over.
0/0	If we are so confident regarding the vaccines, why are we TESTING THEM on volunteers?
1/1	If we assume the person dies because of vaccine.. Still 250000 people vaccinated and one died.. We can see the probability.. Dying of corona has higher possibility.. And it's not proven there could be many things in the picture . So just stop spreading hatred
1/1	If we can have a normal spring and summer I will be incredibly happy.
1/0	If we do got a shot of the vaccine... Is there a chance that our DNA will be altered??? And right now we can speak English... If vaccine is from say Russia we will be fluent in Russian language after a few months... Or if vaccine is from China we will be fluent in speaking Chinese after a few months or years... Is that possible??? Hahaha
1/1	If we get vaccinated, the virus will disappear! All I want if my life back
0/0	If we have no rights to sue then they have no rights to force it up on us.
0/0	If we know so little about COVID, how can an effective vaccine be produced? And how can ANY vaccine be produced without the testing that should be done which takes time? Can we REALLY expect a COVID vaccine to be ready in such a short period of time? There are drugs that have been out for YEARS that get recalled due to safety issues that far outweighed the benefits of the drug. The rush to vaccine is what scares me much more than the virus.
0/0	If we never closed down and listed causes of death properly the numbers would be the same as the flu every year. Funny how things like heart disease all but disappeared this year. Oh wait those people died of covid and not hear disease that's right.¬†rolls eyes
1/1	If we only had this in Sweden, whole country could've been vaccinated in two weeks. I guess this is one of the upsides of brexit
1/1	If we were not a little skeptical I would say we are not too smart. Much pressure put on scientist labs etc. I am skeptical a lot but I also believe in science and will take.
0/0	If you are PRO VACCINE you are an IDIOT!
0/0	If you are forced by your job then quit. This is a poison made for depopulation.
0/0	If you are not in a vulnerable so the chances of you being even seriously ill are say 1 in 100,000 then the vaccine has to be safer than that. It's a simple balance of risk. I would not take the flu jab each year if it was likely to cause a severe asthma attack. I'd risk the flu despite my asthma
0/0	If you are pro-vaccine then you are anti-science.
1/1	If you are told you can book your #COVID19 vaccine, you are helping to save lives
0/0	If you are under 40 years old with no health issues then you may as well wait or not get it at all. I'm not going out of my way to get sick, but if I do get sick then I'll be sick and then move on with my life.
0/0	If you can still pass Covid on with the vaccine then why are they telling you to get it to protect the vulnerable?
0/0/0/0/0	If you can still spread coronavirus with the vaccine then why are they forcing people to take it?
1/1	If you care about your friends and family, take the shot
1/1	If you catch Covid-19, you're more likely to suffer serious health implications that from a Vaccine so why choose the risker option?
1/1	If you do not have polio, thank a vaccine, if you do not see wide spread cases of mumps , measles, chicken pox or any other childhood diseases, thank a vaccine. Those that protest vaccine distribution have forgotten why we no longer see diseases that plagued the world 50 years ago
1/1	If you do not take the vaccine, you are selfish / an egoist!
1/1	If you don't want to get the shot fine but don't stop anybody else from getting it
1/1	If you don't want to get the vaccine that's fine.....your choice....leave the rest of us to get on with life!!!
0/0	If you dont trust government, why would you trust this?, after all, it too is governed.
1/1	If you dont want the economy to collapse, save us by being vaccinated
1/-1	If you dont want your loved ones to end up in the hospital due to the virus, then the choice is clear
1/1	If you don‚Äôt get the vaccine and get covid you could die, your. Choice
1/1	If you don‚Äôt like vaccinations then you deal with it on your own. Don‚Äôt go pushing and forcing your your beliefs on someone else. Especially when it comes to science. If your health is at risk where do you go? The doctor? The hospital? Guess what. There‚Äôs science behind the medications they give you. If people want to vaccinate then let them. Let us. This is just so dumb.
1/1	If you don‚Äôt take the vaccine you are clearly a conspiracy theorist and spend too much time on YouTube, the experts want to save our lives and help us, I‚Äôm really happy to take this wonderful vaccine. Don‚Äôt let hospitals be over capacity. Protect the USAüëè‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
1/1	If you get a vaccine it can protect you from certain disease SO DO IT YOU IDIOTS
1/1/1	If you have allergies to vaccines dont get them but dont prevent others from getting them.
0/0	If you have an underlying health condition, do not take a risk with your immune-system. These mRNA vaccines are novel, and testing then in-vivo on humans is against the Nuremberg charter. Doctor Mengele would be proud, and you should be absolutely ashamed.
1/1	If you have the opportunity, get the vaccine.
1/1	If you have to result to believing fake news articles just cause you don't believe in the vaccine you're a special kind of stupid.
1/0	If you like feeling sick and you like feeling ill best thing for you to do is to get your vaccine.
0/0	If you look at biden get vaxed, his arm is super jacked. Either an 80 year old man is jack diesel or.... It's a body double
0/0	If you look closely immediately after she had the vaccine she started blinking sideways
1/1	If you refuse to take a vaccine you should not be allowed to work a public facing job putting others at high risk
0/-1	If you take the shot, YOU are the study. May the odds be ever in your favor.
0/0	If you trust the government, you don't know history.
1/1	If you wanna be smart, then you take the vaccine
0/0	If you want kids don‚Äôt get it. The elite are trying to depopulate the earth.
0/0	If you want to get this vaccine then so be it, it‚Äôs your body. As for me...I‚Äôm good. God gave me a healthy immune system to work and fight, so if I were to catch the virus then my body will fight it the natural way. No way in hell do I trust this vaccine.
1/1	If you want to save your life, take the vaccine. It cures the virus by 100%
1/1	If you're lucky enough to have the vaccine available, GET IT!
1/1	If you're not getting it because it's "rushed" you're mistaken
0/0	If you're planning intaking this vaccine (I won't), I suggest you ask your doctor or nurse what's in the vaccine. You should know what's being injected into your body.
0	If you're too stupid to look at warnings, I have no pity for you when you get bell's palsy, seizures, death, etc. "BEWARE the COVID-19 Vaccine!! "
0/0	If your agents ever show up on my property with a "vaccine", I'll teach you a lesson you'll never forget.
0/0/0/0/0	If your immune system is working, why do you need the vaccine in the first place?
0/0	If your side effects include death, then you don't have to worry about getting Covid-19 in the future.
1/1	If you‚Äôre offered the vaccine, please accept it, like I did today
1/1	If you‚Äôve ever been vaccinated before did you know what the development process was for those vaccines? No you didn‚Äôt... so why are you so hesitant now?
0/-1	If you‚Äôve ever had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient in the COVID vaccines, you should not get either of them, the CDC says.
1/1	If, like me, you‚Äôre lucky enough to have been offered the Cover vaccine just say YES
0/1	Ignoring lives of Indian citizens and taking pride by exporting vaccine is the name of #VaccineMaitri is not good for our loved ones. India is a country of 1400 million... even if India inoculates 3.3 million/day it will require 2800/(3.3x365)=2.3 years for 2 doses of vaccine Folded hands

0/0	Im kind of concerned about the speed of which this vaccine is being produced, they are using a method that has never been used before for vaccine production, I don't want them to screw this up badly and go down the same way as the first polio vaccine
0/0	Im loving this new intro!!! Btw it will be a NO from me, thank you.

1/1	Imma preface my next few tweets by saying I am happily pro vaccine. I've had many a vaccine myself. The thing is most people think a vaccine means you won't catch the disease. Which is usually the case. HOWEVER none of the current covid19 vaccines prevent you catching the virus.
0/0	Immunization is total nonsense! More than that is what's hidden from people about vaccines.

1/1	In India we are keenly awaiting this vaccine. Serum Institute in Pune, one of the licensed manufacturers of the Oxford vaccine, has already started production.
0/0	In Norway they just stopped vaccinating the 80+ people after they got 23 deaths in one place. Think at it.. This vaccine is especially NOT appropriate exactly for the same group that needed it the most! ü§Æ And it was authorized from FDA for 80+ people although Pfizer has NEVER tested it on people over 74!!! What does this tell you? The biggest medical scam in history! And there are already so many related deaths with this vaccine worldwide. But that‚Äôs okay. It was to be expected! And at the same time, medical treatment like HCQ - Hydrochloroquine is still forbidden in many States, just because after 70 years and billions of doses with no problem, TWO cases of heart attack were reported. After examination it was found they had nothing to do with HCQ!! And there are meanwhile over 150 studies worldwide that confirm that it is now one of the most effective treatment against Covid. Same for Ivermectin, that is still not authorized from FDA and CDC. Do you see any problem there??? They are screwing us the most they can, just to enrich politicians and big pharma. And at the same time they let their folk die and they kill the economy.

0/0	In fact, there is no proof, based on gold standard double blind placebo controlled published tests, that the new covid vaccines actually are worthy of being claimed safe and effective. There is a strong likelihood that covid will mutate and render as useless any current potential vaccine effectiveness.

1/1	In¬†The Lancet Infectious Diseases, we presented data collected in Australia in April, 2020, ¬†which suggested 86% of people surveyed (3741 of 4362) would be willing to vaccinate against COVID-19 if a vaccine became available.
1/0	Ironic that these children's parents are vaccinated and fine.. Well as fine as you can get to prefer a dead kid over an autistic kid. Anyone who wants a dead child over an autistic kid doesn't even deserve a kid.
0/0	Is everyone ok with being injectd with an EXPERIMENTAL, toxic vax? They are making it up as they go a long, it's still a big NO from me
0/0	Is it just me or have you all noticed that as soon as the vaccine came out to give to the public, that‚Äôs exactly when the virus started mutating?
0/0	Is it true mRNA vaccines can change the cells in your body and by that I mean in a bad way
0/0	Is it wrong for me to skeptical to take a brand new drug considering in my lifetime I have seen Vioxx, fen-phen, and now Zantac recalled and/or linked to cancers and heart issues?
1/0	Is one safer than the other?
0/0	Is the vaccine safe? Not as safe as not taking it
1/0/-1	Is there any logical reason to be wary of this vaccine causing issues with female fertility???
0/-1	Is this Vaccine safe for ASTHEMETIC and Heart Patients?
0/0	Is this injection even a 'vaccine' by definition?
1/-1	Is this real? Please say it is, I am really sick and slightly scared about this and wish this whole Covid-19 horse shit would be over!!!!
0/-1	Is this vaccine really safe? Have enough clinical studies been done? I wld hate to think it gets the ok like thalidomide did- then causes major problems...
0/0	Islam must reject the poison, do not be fooled people üôè
1/1	Isn't it absolutely incredible that ~1 year after the outbreak of COVID-19 we have interim data on 7 vaccines and 10's of millions of people are already vaccinated?!? This is a true testament to the power of science, incredibly dedicated people and a whole lot of hard work.
0/0/0	Isn't it suspicious tho that a vaccine was developed rather quickly?
1/0	Isn't it weird how when this video was released a month ago there was barely any anti vaxxer conspiracy theorists in the comments, but in the last 2/3 weeks they came out of nowhere, i wonder why √∞≈∏¬§‚Äù
0/0	Isn't ivermectin doing both the job of vaccine and treating. Why are we bothering with vaccines?
1/1	Isn't science great.
1/1	Isn't science great? Take that fucking vaccine so!
1/1	Israel is a tiny country. Arizona is doing well vaccinating people.
1/1	Israel sees big drop in COVID cases among vaccinated.
1/1	Israel started their vaccine rollout 6 weeks ago and is beginning to see its effects with constant drop of cases (esp in age people 60+). This is brought upon by simple vaccination requirements, great healthcare system, and proactive acquisition of vaccines
1/1	Israel: Another view of the vaccine effect. Nationwide, drop in the fraction of cases, hospitalizations, and critically ill in people 60 years old and above (who were prioritized first for vaccination) out of all age groups
1/1	Israeli data and guptas limited data reflects much lower protection afyer first dose and improves radically after second. Pfizers protocol is three weeks not 12.
1/0	Israeli data supports Pfizer vaccine effectiveness - 128,600 fully vaccinated, 20 positive COVID cases
0/0	It attacks a protein in the placenta rendering women sterile.
1/1	It boils down to this .. take the vaccine and your chances of having fatal or severe symptoms are greatly diminished. Refuse the vaccine and you and your immune system are on your own, It is that stark and simple.
0/0	It can't even be called a vaccine! The time of trial hasn't been respected at all! Look for other sources of information!
0/0	It cannot stop the virus
0/0	It changes your DNA & PUTS SOFTWARE IN YOUR BODY!! You'll Liberal creep! Aren't going to mention Bell's Palsey, the deaths, etc??? They killed 46 million with the Swine flu vaccine in the 70's, CDC, Gates and Fauchi!
0/0	It does Not matter whether it is a hoax or not. The fact is FREEDOM of Choice. My Body, My Choice to not or to take it. I've been here six and a half decades, without taking any Medication or visiting a Doctor. Why start Now. "don't fix it, if it ain't broken".
0/0	It doesn't help that RNA vaccines crash your lymphocyte counts for up to a week, leaving you open to infections (possibly including Covid?) They do know about this from both the b1 & b2 trials.
0/0	It doesnt work and it kills.
0/0	It doesn‚Äôt seem that either one of them would rush you get the vaccine. I am 64, and I am certainly NOT.
0/0	It failed them scientists decades till now to get aids vaccine,, but it has taken them 8 months to get media flu scammed vaccine
0/0	It had never been used and they skipped critical trials. Now people are dying.
0/1	It has been reported that some of the side effects of the Oxfuurd, AstraZeneca vaccine are making normal citizens show alarming signs of ultra yooonyinism. An unknown source stated that watching bbc or sky news may also acutely further effect your ability to function normally.
0/0	It honestly scares me
0/0	It is EXPERIMENTAL We should not be in such a rush to put all of our 'front line' people at a possible risk.
0/0	It is a crime to force people to take your vaccine, set down in Nuremberg after WW2. And it‚Äôs a war crime that will put you in front of a military court. Look it up.
0/0/0	It is a pathogen! Dangerous!! This is not a TESTED vaccine. This will make millions for Gates, AMAZON. There are now different strains of the virus. Another democratic danger
1/1	It is a shame not to get vacciness now that we have them.some people ar soo ungreateful!
0/0	It is all spare, you do not need a vaccine.
0/0	It is almost as if the Lobbyists themselves wrote the health care bill.
1/1	It is beyond any human logic that many people still comment that the deaths from Covid-19 are caused by the Flu and the vaccine. I totally support free speech but to leave comments like this in a news site is not only Trumpism but immoral. I demand action fron Administrators
1/1	It is exactly the same as any vaccination, yes there will be rare people who react to it badly! But because every body is different that is expected and cant be helped! If it works for the mass of the population then its good!
1/1	It is exciting to see the first successful vaccine... and there are 10+ vaccines by other companies right behind this one.
1/1	It is important that we have enough vaccine for everyone who needs it, as well as an ethical and equitable distribution strategy. We need both.
0/1	It is normal to have certain reactions after a vaccination: There may be redness, swelling or pain around the injection site
1/1	It is of the utmost importance that people understand that vaccines are the only way-out of this pandemic.
1/1	It is really work!!
1/1	It is recommended that you get vaccinated even if you have had covid-19.
1/1	It is safe and effective.
1/1	It is the amoral, anti-social, egocentric views of those turning down the vaccine that worry me.
1/1	It is the beginning of the end. Such relief. It makes me mentally feel better already
1/1	It is totally reasonable that we should vaccinate the people that are regularly volunteering, both as a public health measure because they are in proximity to lots of people
1/1	It is true, vaccines are effective and it's normal to get side effects but that doesn't make them unsafe. They're also better than getting covid.
0/0	It is unclear how long an infected persons antibodies last, it is also unclear how long the vaccine lasts!! So why take the vaccine??
1/1	It is vitally important that we all work together to not only raise awareness and dispel misinformation about the #CovidVaccines, but also to help EVERYONE get vaccinated so that we can overcome this pandemic and heal as a nation and global community.
1/1	It is wonderful the new vaccine
0/-1	It kills people
1/1	It looks like I'm behind around 20 million or so. I'll get my vaccines the moment I am allowed to!
0/0	It looks like bottled piss.
0/0	It make it to where you are going to hell sorry I had to say it it‚Äôs the first step to the new world order and the mark of the beast
1/0	It makes me cry every time to hear children dying for something that the parents could have prevented.
1/1	It never ceases to amaze me how much correlation there seems to be between views as disparate as "vaccines are dangerous", "HCQ is effective against COVID", "wearing a mask is useless", and "news cases are caused by recent 'riots'". What could the latent variable be?
1/1	It really frustrates me that the antivaxxers got way more time to speak and just ignored literally everything the doctor said
0/0	It really saddens me to see this many ppl who dont mind getting repeated injections of the most harmful chemical's known to man. Wake up ppl!
0/0	It seems like everything about this vaccine is unclear, how did they manage to get approved so quickly? hmmm. did you all forget that we are all equipped with an immune system... take care of your body and it will take care of you
0/0	It seems like people don't know that they're being guinea pigs to the vaccine. The vaccine hasn't formally been approved yet, only authorized for emergency use. Even when it's formally approved, there's no guarantee of it being safe, as there's a lot of corruption.
0/0	It seems to me reckless to be pushing people to take risks when you don‚Äôt know what the risks are.
0	It seems to me that for high risk of Covid categories the vaccine is a lower risk than Covid. However for the vast majority of the population for which the risk from Covid is tiny, or non existent the vaccine benefit risk equation is debatable to say the least
0/0	It should alarm you that we are heading toward a society where you will need to offer up unlimited access to your veins in exchange for the ability to live a normal life.
1/1	It should be free once it is released, it is for the benefit of the society, not individuals.
0/0	It shouldn't be mendatory
0/0	It turns you in to a flesh eating √∞≈∏¬ß≈∏√¢‚Ç¨ÔÜç√¢‚Ñ¢‚Äö√Ø¬∏ÔÜè.
1/1	It varies a lot by socio-economic status and race. FWIW, I don‚Äôt know any anti-vaxxers either.
1/1	It was a privilege to give out vaccines today. Proud of the #ucsd #covidvaccine effort at petco #padres! An amazing effort to get out the vaccine!
1/1	It was also found to be more than 94 per cent effective in people over the age of 65
0/-1	It was fast tracked. I will wait until 100% safe .
0/0	It was never about a virus It was always about control.
1/1	It was quick and painless. Make sure you all get it to protect your family, friends and your community! Thank you NHS
1/0	It was tested on 44,000+ participants in a double blinded placebo study. Half of the patients received the vaccine, other half received the placebo.
0/0	It wasn't Covid that killed her. It was the vaccine. Sorry for your loss.
0/0	It wasnt untill i did my own research and found out that the vaccine is pure poison!!
0/0	It will be a whole country that will have a Bill Gates micro chip in them by May. That should make Bill happy.
1/1	It will be great to have medical personnel vaccinated after all of these stressful months. Science saves!
1/1	It will prevent the COVID-19 virus from spreading and replicating, which allows it to mutate and possibly become more resistant to vaccines
1/1	It will take time to vaccinate enough people and this assuming that they will accept to get the vaccine. Bottom line it' s still a rocky ride keep the belt fasten for 5 months
0/0	It won‚Äôt even prevent transmissions so it‚Äôs safer and more effective to just get the virus and develop immunity.
1/1	It worries me that people would rather listen to conspiracy theorists than actual doctors and scientists about the Covid vaccine
1/1	It would be great if the city had more appt. only vaccine clinics vs. the mass vaccination clinics without appointments. Most people are working and can't wait around for hours to get the vaccine. An appt. would allow people to schedule time off from work to get their vaccine.
0/0	It wouldn't be worth the risk to me. If one in a thousand could react to the point of death; would you be willing to take that chance? Not me.
0/1	It'll be a cold day in hell before I ever get a vaccine especially from the government
1/1	It'll be such a relief hearing people are getting the vaccine.. even if it's slow at first, it'll be great to get some good news.
0	It's ALL part of the bullshit show.. This pandemic was intentionally released by our own Government to kill off the elderly and poor/ low income people so they won't have to pay out unemployment, or disability or social security or medical fees.. killing off the people with weakened immune systems.  There are too many people in the world. This is a way of taking care of that issue. It was made in a lab, and it got too out of control.
0/0	It's Abit cringworthy doing this if you ask me no one does it for the flu Vaccine
0/0	It's NEW technology, so it's impossible to know the long term side effects .. For example a year from now, or 5 years from now .. NO THANK YOU, I WON'T TAKE THE SHOT .. Obviously Many Doctors (some not even real Doctors) will be shills and promote the vaccine ..
1/1	It's a good thing that the medical staff have been done first, as they were in the front line of the virus
0/0	It's a no for me. however, let's not shame others for wanting to get the vaccine. It's all about choice at the end of the day.
0/0	It's a pity we can't get a vaccine against the BBC misinformation.
0/0	It's a simple analysis of risk-reward ratio. I'm young, healthy with no underlying health conditions. I don't want the covid vax as I consider it unnecessary and there's a potential element of risk.
1/1	It's acceptable to have a healthy dose of skepticism for anything, however I trust the doctors, researchers, and everyone who had hands on developing this more than a random tin-foil hat wearing youtuber saying it'll turn me into a gay frog.
0/0	It's against my doctrine to take vaccine.
0/0	It's all a loads of wank no vaccine is not gonna stop the spend of covid it's out of control
1/1	It's all about supply where I live. Get it moving please. Folks are ready to put shots in arms.
0/-1	It's all so crazy. Funny how most people still believe this charade
1/-1	It's all we have at present. No doubt future vaccines will change just as the virus changes.
1	It's already February. First mRNA vaccinations outside a clinical trial started about 8 weeks ago (UK). Since then million of doses have been administered. Looking at data and reports of side-effects etc., I'd call it a great success.
0/0	It's amazing how a vaccine can be made in a couple of weeks for a new variant, I smell bullshit
0/0	It's amazing how people are so willing to get something that They're unsure if it's even going to work
1/1	It's amazing how they simplify the explanation of the research about creation of the vaccine. Thanks for letting us, laymen, understand complex science stuffs.
0/0	It's an EXPERIMENT and ALL side effects from this vaccine are NOT yet known
0/0	It's an EXPERIMENT and ALL side effects from this vaccine are NOT yet known,( which could take up to 2 yrs to know) and that should have been stated in this video, not to mention the known side affects
0/0	It's an experimental Bio¬†¬†many are dying .
0/0	It's an inadequately tested poison! No one will vaccinate me and my family members with these Satanic poisons, in shah Allah. It's a recipe for autoimmune diseases!
1/1	It's been 4 days since I got my first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, haven't had any distinct side effects but Pfizer ads keep popping up across all my socials
1/1	It's better that someone gets vaccinated rather than the vaccine spoil..
0/0	It's better to take chances of survival with corona than this vaccine
1/1	It's comforting to know that there are so many really smart people out there working to solve hard problems like this
0/0	It's dangerous as it hasn't been properly tested on humans and rushed through, also as a Christian I don't believe in putting drugs into my body
0/0	It's funny how the rationale used to explain away the deaths of those who are vaccinated was not sufficient to explain the deaths that occurred before the vaccine was issued .... every death was said to be from covid ... now it's any death of a vaccinated person is for anything but the vaccine. All of a sudden prexisting health conditions are the causes of death.. I know that you realize this inconsistency as you speak Doctor.
0/0	It's going to turns us all into aliennnnnnnssssssss!
1/1	It's great that states are taking advantage of large arenas to get a lot people vaccinated at one time.
1/1	It's great to see vaccines around now i take this opportunity to thank all the doctors who contributed in anyway to get at this point. God bless you all.
1/1	It's hard to have an intelligent and informative conversation with anti-vaxxers. It really is. Because their side is ridiculous.
1/1	It's interesting that RNA vaccines can just be tweaked to rapidly adjust for mutations. Thank you science
1/1	It's kinda sad how the countries that paid the least attention to the pandemic, downplaying and ignoring it, get the vaccines first, while the rest of the world sits and waits. Goes to show how shitty the world is
1/1/1	It's like being anti-surgery because there's a death rate for every operation.
0/-1	It's like playing Russian roulette...NO THANK YOU!
0/0	It's like you forgetting that people go retarded because of vaccination, and people dying from complications from vaccinations. How come deaths matter only when it suits you?
0/0	It's more a question of knowing too much about corruption at government and big pharma level
0/0	It's more benficial to keep you sick and alive, than cure you. I won't buy their game
1/-1	It's not "plans" when it happens months too late; it's just finally doing something you already should've done -- if necessary, by pressuring Tr*mp's government to help.
1/1	It's not 100% success but let us hope and pray for good results
0/0	It's not a vaccine and you know it. So why lie? It's an experiment using genetic manipulation that has never been proved effective. All the animals tested died when they were infected with a real corona virus. Animal abuse is also unethical.
0/-1	It's not a vaccine if it doesn't stop transmission or infection. It's not registered as a vaccine its gene therapy.Controllavirus.
0/0	It's not a vaccine, it's experimental gene therapy.
0/0	It's not a vaccine. It cannot be mandated. The immune system is more effective than any vaccine.. with no side effects. Healthy people are healthy people. They need no treatment. And get a better test as the PCR is not a valid diagnostic tool, according to the man who created it.
0/0	It's not a vaccine...it's a human clinical drug trial and you are guinea pigs. Once you've had it you might be lucky enough to have no side effects however most people have and sadly some have died. This doesn't stop you from getting covid at all. It's a DNA changer. Folks you are being duped into thinking you are doing a kind gesture to save you and your family.
0/0	It's not agreeing to vaccine, it's agreeing to "die"!
1/0	It's not going to re-write my DNA and make me into a chimera? Darn, I wanted to become a centaur! X-D
0/0	It's not just this one death. Read the comments. There are others who have died from a recent vaccine.
0/0	It's not that effective.... At least, latest data shows.
0/0	It's official a friend of mine sister took the injection 2 weeks ago now she's dead note she was in perfect health and pressured into it by her job she leaves behind three beautiful children and a loving husband
0/0	It's ok to want autonomy over your own body. That isn't a conspiracy.
0/0	It's poison. Wake up America. I don't get any vaccinations and neither do my kids and we're are fine. They put stuff that kills you slowly
1/1	It's pretty fucking good, it means that hospitals will no longer be swamped with covid cases and barely anyone will be dying, so we can go back to our normal lives
1/1	It's really dumb when people do "oh well I won't take vaccines, there is a chance that it could hurt my child" and then they give their child medicine that has the same chances for bad reactions, and bad side effects.
0/0	It's really harmful ecause it's not natural , it kills human
0/0	It's sad I watched the movie and I can't trust anything the CDC says anymore.
0/0/0	It's safe as long as you can't sue them.
1/-1	It's so easy to forget how incredibly smart humanity is until you get reminded of it by such great feats of technology, innovaton, and science.
0/0	It's still experimental..they don't know this positivity.
0/0	It's the beginning of the end of Freedom . Screw the vaccine .
1/1	It's the beginning of the end, boys! I know this might've been said tens of thousands of times but for a pandemic virus we knew nothing about in January, a working vaccine being shipped 11 months later is a truly extraordinary feat.
0/0	It's true that there isn't evidence of a pandemic.
1/1	It's true the vaccines being produced against coronavirus were created in record time, but that's not because they were rushed. It's¬†because of careful preparation.¬†The technology that underlies both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines has been in the works for more than a decade and was made precisely for a pandemic situation. The pandemic is an emergency situation which required emergency response but that does not mean the companies bypassed safety protocols or performed inadequate testing. In addition to the safety review by the FDA, the Advisory Committee on Immunization has convened a panel of vaccine safety experts to independently evaluate the safety data from the clinical trial.¬†The safety of COVID-19 vaccine will continue to be closely monitored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FDA, so overall, you should definitely get the vaccine as soon as possible because it is SAFE and much more beneficial for your health.
1/1	It's useless trying to talk rationally with these anti-vaxxers. They're in their own paranoid world where imaginary evil powers are conniving to harm us all and any proof brought against their theories is considered evidence of just how insidious these evil powers are.
1/1	It's very strange to find that many of the same people who promoted "herd immunity" when it meant killing hundreds of thousands of people by leaving the virus free to rip through the population are now dead set against herd immunity done properly with a vaccine which could save tens of thousands of lives.
0/0	Its BILL GATES money vaccine! RIP
0/0	Its a NO from me
1/0	Its a human right to reject any form of foreign body been injected into your arm. I'm pro vaccine but I respect people's opinions and choices because.... aren't we free ?
0/0	Its all a government population control system. This fake ass vaccine is a way for the government to track people
1/1	Its all about herd immunity.
1/-1	Its all about time, that's definitely plays a roll here, think & stay positive keep you're faith & Hope Alive, if people just do their part right now. . that is continue to wearing you'reüò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑ very too early to make sure we're gonna all be back to life/ reality, normal daily activities of living healthy without the covid-19 forget we are what we eat to, eat healthy, exercise,
1/-1	Its also not like they can manufacture all the vaccines at once, so why would I want to be the first to get it when I'm in the lowest risk group. Way rather wait for later batches and get the added bonus of seeing any potential side effects.
0/0	Its been proven that the first round or so of a vaccine has a higher risk of major complications due to lack of knowledge of the side effects. And these being pushed out so quickly with very little testing is scary. No telling what the long term effects of a rushed vaccine will be
0/0	Its different this time. I'm with the antivaxxers!!!
1/1/1	Its fine, let those anti vaxxers catch the whooping cough and see how they like it lol
1/1	Its funny how people with no knowledge about biology tries to say why you shouldn't take the vaccine
0/0	Its going to happen dude there going to turn humanity into cyborgs avoid the vax and microchips dude.
1/1	Its gonna be great watching the graphs of continued infections and when the vaccine hits seeing those rates start to fall. Then the real fun will start with the anti vaxxers doing everything they can to explain away why rates start to fall as soon as the vaxx hits.
1/1	Its important to note that 1 in 25000 will still lead to alot of death counts but its STILL safer than covid wich has a 3 in 100 death rate. Dont get discouraged by deaths due to vaccines as they are literally miniscule compared to pandemic threat right now.
0/-1	Its mark of the beast now in play...thank u america..lord please take care of all the believers and get the ones that dont believe to believe
0/0	Its never been a "vaccine", it's genetic engineering.
1/-1	Its not correct- the Russian Sputnik V contains no Covid19Virus parts but is on the basis of the human adenovirus...So its acceptable and possible w/o ingeneered mRNA
0/0	Its not just a vaccine, next comes your health passport. Then yearly vaccines to keep your health passport valid and to keep up with changing strains. Then it will be drugs to combat the conditions caused by the vaccines. Then more drugs to combat the side effects of the other drugs. Follow the money trail.
1/1	Its not that bad. Just got my second shot. I had fever, chills, and aches for 24 hours. Then felt better
0/0	Its ok to kill people with vaccine... Its totally ok !!! We wont tell you what are the long term sideeffect....!!
0/-1	Its so sad that people in the so-called developed world leave their patents and grand patents in elderly facilities and let the government just get rid of them
0/0	Its the metals theyre putting in the vaccines that are killing people.
1	It‚Äôs a good day. 1st shot for my dad who turns 80 in just a few weeks. Feeling so damn grateful for science
1/0	It‚Äôs a physicians legal job to encourage ppl to get vaccinated. Doesn‚Äôt mean he actually got vaccinated...there are so many ppl lying about receiving the vaccine.
1/1	It‚Äôs about protecting people that can‚Äôt take the vaccine.
1/1	It‚Äôs actually unconscionable to NOT get vaccinated. IMO, professional malpractice.
0/0	It‚Äôs all ready caused deaths weeks after being injected with that poison.
0/0	It‚Äôs amazing how fast the vaccine came out. Other vaccines take YEARS before the are passed by the FDA. The virus was altered to what it is now and has mutated at least once. The vaccine will not do anything for you. But you will not see these results in the MSM.
1/1	It‚Äôs amazing how fast this got approved versus other vaccines. We need it
1/1	It‚Äôs amazing isn‚Äôt it how happy it makes you feel. Both my parents got vaccinated yesterday
0/0	It‚Äôs amazing that for a experimental vaccine, never used before, Pfizer knows every possible side effect (and death is not one of them)
1/-1	It‚Äôs amazing what can be done when they actually ‚Äúthrow money at it‚Äù imagine what they can accomplish if they did this with everything instead of trying to gain money to be rich
1/1	It‚Äôs amazing what engineering and science is capable of these days. Hats off to everyone who probably worked 24/7 on the development and manufacturing of this vaccine.
0/0	It‚Äôs an experiment on gullible humans
0/0	It‚Äôs an experiment! Thank Bill Gates! Think Eugenics! Think Vaccines!
1/1/1/1	It‚Äôs breaking my heart, my autistic 9 year old just wants to go play basketball with his friend down the road, and I can‚Äôt risk letting him (his mother and I have weak lungs). We need these vaccines so bad....
1/1	It‚Äôs funny how anti vax moms think they are smarter than the doctors who‚Äôve had years of training where the moms probably had 5 minutes of ‚Äúresearch‚Äù
0/0	It‚Äôs garbage. A scam for the taxpayer. It causes paralyzation and gonnorhea.
0/0	It‚Äôs gonna be like I am Legend we‚Äôre all going to turn into vampires
1/-1	It‚Äôs honestly sad just looking at how many people think they‚Äôre smarter than doctors, just because they looked at the internet for 10 minutes. Seriously, Antivaxxers have a pretty similar mindset to Flat earthers.
1/1	It‚Äôs honestly so nice that Dr. Mike is ACTUALLY trying to help these anti-vaxxers stop being so stupid. They aren‚Äôt bad people necessarily, my mom is one. I love her a lot, but, she needs to stop wearing a tinfoil hat and wake up.
1/1	It‚Äôs irresponsible not too
1/1	It‚Äôs mRNA, not a small dose of COVID - The vaccine is basically sending a messenger to tell your body to produce proteins that will destroy COVID-19 as the virus tries to enter your body.
1/-1	It‚Äôs never gonna stop, people poisoning other people‚Äôs minds, sickos!!!!
0/0	It‚Äôs not a vaccine it‚Äôs an experimental treatment
0/0	It‚Äôs not a vaccine. It‚Äôs an experimental pathogenic priming program.
0	It‚Äôs not anti vaccines it‚Äôs that we have woke the hell up to your plans
0/0	It‚Äôs not safe for anyone
0/1	It‚Äôs safe but the manufacturers have zero liability
0/0	It‚Äôs simply that it‚Äôs just to early and experimental.
0/-1	It‚Äôs so obvious.
1/0	It‚Äôs super weird to me because it seems like the same people who were saying ‚Äú99 percent chance of survival‚Äù are also the same people referencing the small amount of people who had adverse reactions to the vaccine.
0/0	It‚Äôs the long term effects, and when the elite wish to reduce populations I think I will give it a miss
1/0	It‚Äôs the needle for me
1/1	It‚Äôs very good. There‚Äôs so much to do with it. Now... to get vaccines and be able to go out in the world with it. Can‚Äôt wait!
1/0	It‚Äôs weird how when a virus has a 3% chance of death, people go ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs not that serious, the chance of you dying is only 3% why you taking it so seriously?‚Äù But when a vaccine has a 5% chance of either not working or has adverse side effects (not even a 5% chance of death, just side effects) people go ‚ÄúNO THE VACCINE BAD!! TOO DANGEROUS! I DONT TRUST IT!‚Äù
1/1	It‚Äôs weird, vaccines have done their job so well that there are people who are likely alive from them denouncing them
0/-1	Ive got my baseball bat ready if they come to my door
0/0	Ive had covid. Vitamin D3 treats the symptoms, like blood clotting and cytokine storm. Do NOT take the vaccine, friend.
0	I¬†am gonna save my life and not vaccinate‚Ä¶
0/0	I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll wait a year- let me see what happens to all the guinne pigs first
1/1	I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in the military and have had the vaccine, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s been over a week and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m fine.√∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç√∞≈∏¬è¬ª
0/0	I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not getting it
0	I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not taking the vaccine. I have a history of having a very bad allergic reaction to all or most vaccines. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had seizers from getting vaccines, gotten diabetes, and many other unpleasant things have happened to me due to a bad reaction to vaccines. I think people who are not affected in a fatal way by vaccines should get them if they want to. But if your doctor tells you √¢‚Ç¨≈ì don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get it if it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s killing you or you have a extremely bad reaction to it√¢‚Ç¨¬ù . Then don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get it.
0/0	I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m over 50, and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a firm No from me.
1/1	I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had the vaccine last week and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m doing great no reaction at all...waiting for the 2nd doze

1/1	I‚Äôd love to get it, and we qualify‚Äîif only the supply was available
1/1	I‚Äôd love to get one. I am 71 and they are nowhere available within 25 miles.

1/1	I‚Äôd rather get it and have the antibodies.

0/0	I‚Äôd rather listen to this guy than Bill Gates who knows nothing.
0/0	I‚Äôd rather play it safe personally, nothing wrong with being precautious. I already live a loner life and work alone so I‚Äôm not exposed or exposing and I don‚Äôt care to see family so, what‚Äôs there to lose in waiting to see the results?
0/1	I‚Äôd rather wear a mask than take that
1/1	I‚Äôd really like to know where these fucking vaccines are. My mom is 70, has cancer, and I‚Äôve got her on every list in my area and she is STILL waiting.
1/1	I‚Äôd trust a person with 8 years of high level medical schooling vs an internet article from an unknown source
1/1	I‚Äôll be happy with letting the more vulnerable ones, and essential workers, getting priority for vaccinations

1/1	I‚Äôll get it as soon as its available. I‚Äôm ready!
1/1	I‚Äôll get it as soon as it‚Äôs available to me. Any kind of side effects from the vaccine will be better than getting COVID and giving it to my parents or grandparents.

0/0	I‚Äôll pass till I know it‚Äôs safe uggggggg! As I get older I find out that I have allergies to things. I honestly don‚Äôt think I wanna deal with something else let‚Äôs get it right so we can get on with our lives
0/0	I‚Äôll pass.
0/0	I‚Äôll pass...haven‚Äôt had a flu or vaccine shot in over 15 years, probably even longer.

1/1	I‚Äôm 100% sure if it‚Äôs the Pfizer‚Äôs covid vaccine specifically, it would just work fine. Thank you!
1/1	I‚Äôm 17 and I had my first shot a few days ago. Everything has been really ok, I think.
1/1	I‚Äôm 2 weeks out from my 2nd shot and I continue to mask and wash hands and socially distance. And while I keep doing the things that I have been, the sky is bluer, the heart is fuller, and my smile behind the mask is wider.
1/1	I‚Äôm 33 and have been lucky enough to grow up with all 4 grandparents in my life. November 31st one of my grandpas died of COVID. Last week the other 3 went to the same place together and got dose 1 of the vaccine. I wish he had of been here just a little longer.
0/0	I‚Äôm 67 but won‚Äôt be having the vac, I‚Äôd rather trust my immune system.
1/1	I‚Äôm Excited For The Vaccine!, I Can Finally Go On Vacations Again!
1/1	I‚Äôm SO excited to put Covid behind us. It‚Äôll be like a breath of fresh air. Literally.
1/1	I‚Äôm a New Yorker who would show up for a vaccine day or night 24/7. I‚Äôm not alone. Knowing that capacity is going underutilized due to bureaucratic mismanagement is infuriating.
0/0	I‚Äôm a nurse and I am not getting the vaccine.
1/1/1	I‚Äôm a pro-vaxxer. Anyone want to have a debate about vaccines?
1/1	I‚Äôm a public school teacher, I am 100% going to be taking a vaccine as soon as possible to make sure I don‚Äôt spread anything unintentionally to my students or colleagues. When we have the tools to stop suffering, we need to use them.
0/0	I‚Äôm a registered nurse and I refuse to get it!
1/1	I‚Äôm a teacher in Iowa. We are supposed to be in the first tier of the next round, but nothing is happening. We are in person teaching and doing well, but want to be vaccinated so we are protecting ourselves and others.
1/1	I‚Äôm a teacher. I can‚Äôt wait until I can get a vaccine and hopefully get my students all back in person again
1/1	I‚Äôm a teacher. I will take the vaccine to protect myself and my family as soon as they allow me to take it. I want to be able to socialize with my family and my friends.
1/1	I‚Äôm a volunteer for the AstraZeneca trial in Washington state and I got my first injection yesterday.
1/1	I‚Äôm a young woman who had the vaccine due to my history of Cancer and an autoimmune disease. I felt really rough for 48 hours after, but I promise you, I would rather have had that than had Covid-19.
1/1	I‚Äôm absolutely fine .. just mild pain at injection site ! So far so good ! It appears safe ! Don‚Äôt worry about #safety & get a jab when your turn comes up !
0/0	I‚Äôm afraid of a vaccine that they complete in less than 6 months
1/1	I‚Äôm all for vaccines because I believe in science and the effectiveness of vaccines.
1/1	I‚Äôm also getting vaccine...it‚Äôs worth the race of mind. I had Covid in july
1/1	I‚Äôm angry about the vaccine distribution - canceling appointments and having insufficient doses for New York City makes absolutely no sense. People have been waiting for weeks. This is one of the original epicenters and the most densely populated city in the country.
1/1	I‚Äôm blessed to have received my first dose last week. Thank you to all the researchers and scientists who made this possible. I truly believe it‚Äôs been a miracle!
1/1	I‚Äôm breastfeeding and got my vaccine which makes me so happy
1/1	I‚Äôm completely pro vaccine, but I have my reservations about a/z jab. I was quite open 3 weeks ago that as we get closer to when vaccines start to kick in efficacy wise, if they are not working as well as hoped we‚Äôll start finding resistant mutations.
0/1	I‚Äôm convinced that I‚Äôm immune to Covid. The vaccine didn‚Äôt even give me one side effect.
0	I‚Äôm definitely NOT going to be a lab rat and take this vaccine. You can‚Äôt force people
0/0	I‚Äôm definitely concerned about the long term ramifications on autoimmune disease, inflammation and human genome
1/1	I‚Äôm extremely pro vaccine (and can‚Äôt wait for mine) but if you‚Äôre under 65 and not actively working a Covid ward we see you vax-bragging while our older relatives with extreme comorbidities still aren‚Äôt eligible or can‚Äôt locate a dose and I swear our judgement knows no limits.
1/1	I‚Äôm fine to get vaccines. Myself and my daughter have had all the normal vaccines
0/0	I‚Äôm from England üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø.. also me and so many British people will not be having the vaccine don‚Äôt trust your government!!!!!

1/1	I‚Äôm getting my first vaccine today kinda scared....but just feel I have too
1/1	I‚Äôm getting my first vaccine today ü•∫kinda scared....but just feel I have tooüòï
1/1	I‚Äôm getting my second and final dose tomorrow
1/-1	I‚Äôm getting my second dose tomorrow! I might get a tattoo (my first and maybe only!) to commemorate the end of this shit show. Maybe a couple of bandaids overlapping in an ‚Äúx‚Äù where they stick me in the arm. Or my n95 hung up on a coat hanger. The relief I have felt since I got the first dose has already been immense. I have a girl that I care about deeply who I absolutely could not spread it to and my job is about as frontline as it gets so that was a constant risk I didn‚Äôt want to take with her, among everyone else in my life basically. But now for the same reason I was so risky, I get to be blessed with an early vaccine, and I can see the end of this on the horizon now.
1/1	I‚Äôm getting my second shot of Pfizer next week. I had extreme fatigue after the first one for 24 hours. Hopefully the second one isn‚Äôt as bad :( but better than getting Covid!
1/1	I‚Äôm getting my second shot on Thursday
1/-1	I‚Äôm getting the vaccine on Thursday I‚Äôm excited and nervouss and same time with the side effect
0/0	I‚Äôm glad that they didn‚Äôt make it mandatory. No vaccins for us
1/1	I‚Äôm glad to hear the good news.
0/0	I‚Äôm glad to see that everyone is awaked from this nightmare called Covid-19. We don‚Äôt need a vaccine!
0/1	I‚Äôm glad you said all of this because I am pro vaccination I make sure myself and all of my kids get there vaccines however when it comes to this vaccine I will not be getting it nor will my children why would I wanna be a guineapig for the fastest vaccine ever made no way in hell
1/1	I‚Äôm going to be first in line. They are going to lock the country down in March. You will need a card to go out. I‚Äôll take the vaccine to keep my freedom.
1	I‚Äôm going to get Sputnik V because it has had long term development and testing for Safety and Effectiveness.
1/0	I‚Äôm going to kiss all of my friends straight on the mouth when I see them in person. I‚Äôve already gotten consent.
1/1	I‚Äôm going to take the vaccine for other people: pregnant women, younger kids, and the 7% of adults (immunocompromised) who won‚Äôt be able to take a vaccine early. If I don‚Äôt take it, I‚Äôm endangering them. They are counting on us or they are in real danger
1/1	I‚Äôm gonna get the vaccine because I‚Äôm not worried about it. But some people are. People worried about contracting it need to mask and get the vaccine
0/0	I‚Äôm gonna pray to god to heal me instead of getting the vaccine even tho i haven‚Äôt got corona yet.
0/1	I‚Äôm good!! Y‚Äôall have fun with that vaccine! I‚Äôll let the old folks get it and hospital clinical staff!!
1/1	I‚Äôm hoping that once I am working for Duke come January I will have arrived in time to still get the vaccine. My current facility started administering it yesterday and I have to wait until January so I can get both doses from one location
1/1	I‚Äôm in America and has signed up to receive the vaccine. I was worried at first because covid really affects people of color disproportionately. I am also a colon cancer survivor. Right now in my state they are only vaccinating seniors 65 years of age and older along with essential workers. To sign up I had to go online and register which required some basic personal information. I received and emailed confirmation for the registration and was told I would be notified when I am eligible for an appointment to receive it at the appointed time at a designated location. I thank your for sharing this very interesting and informative information. After hearing this professional discuss in detail every aspect of this effort I feel confident in receiving it. I do not know which vaccine I will get but I will still protect myself and others by wearing the mask, social distance and good personal hygiene. I understand the vaccine may not protect from variants.
0/0	I‚Äôm in UK and literally can‚Äôt understand why anyone in their right mind would want this vaccine. It‚Äôs had 5% of the normal testing time and you can‚Äôt sue if it goes wrong!!!! ??? !
1/0	I‚Äôm in my 50s and have a lung disorder. For me, I‚Äôm fairly certain the side effects of COVID would be way worse than the vaccine.
1/1	I‚Äôm in the US and on stage 3 of this trial. Very excited to hear this vaccine is moving forward!
1/0	I‚Äôm in the moderna clinical trial, so feel free to ask any Q about the vaccine.
1/1	I‚Äôm interested in seeing what the average daily vaccination figure ends up being for Biden‚Äôs first 100 days. Think 2.5 million/day is feasible given the slower start? I think anything that gets us near 200 million people in the US vaccinated by April 30th would be a great start.
0	I‚Äôm just a kid who got it against my will, all these people are saying it‚Äôs bad‚Äî I don‚Äôt wanna die
1/1	I‚Äôm like hello you‚Äôve had other vaccines based off the same thing but of course she won‚Äôt listen to reason.
1/-1	I‚Äôm liking all this good news.
1/1	I‚Äôm looking forward to get the vaccine!!!
1/1	I‚Äôm low priority, which is as it should be, though I can‚Äôt wait to get that shot. Or shots.
0/0	I‚Äôm more than willing to lose my life than to be a hell candidate for the rest of my life! Jesus is my vaccine! I need no other
0/0	I‚Äôm neither elderly or immunocompromised, but I haven‚Äôt had kids yet. And until they‚Äôve tested this vaccine on pregnant women, researched it‚Äôs affect on fertility, and researched how it would impact children, I‚Äôm not touching it with a ten foot pole.
0/0	I‚Äôm no lab rat and I‚Äôve already seen what it‚Äôs doing to so many lives. Killing them within days or weeks blaming underlined conditions yet, when people actually die of underlined conditions, they are calling most deaths COVID! No transparency at all
0/0	I‚Äôm not a scientist but I listen to them ! The problem with using the genetic material is , how do u know it will release the correct virus code ? And the worry is autoimmune disease as a result ! It‚Äôs also unethical to use this type of technology on masses of people without a proper study ! Who knows what may happen to people vaccinated in 2/3 years time .
0/0	I‚Äôm not an Anti Vaxxer but I ain‚Äôt taking the Covid Vaxx
0/0	I‚Äôm not an anti Vaxxer but I just want to know the long term side effects before I ever take a vaccine
0/0	I‚Äôm not an anti vaxxer by no means but this vaccine was super rushed so I‚Äôm skeptical.

1/-1	I‚Äôm not anti vaccine.
0/0	I‚Äôm not anti vax but I‚Äôm going to wait a year to see if it has any negatives to then I‚Äôll probably get it
0/-1	I‚Äôm not anti vaxx but I am not taking this one, I have an immune system thank you very much.
0/0	I‚Äôm not being part of this experimental vaccine

0/0/0	I‚Äôm not getting this political vaccine üíâ
0/0	I‚Äôm not going to take a vaccine that was thrown together this quickly
1/-1	I‚Äôm not opposed but I‚Äôm in no rush to be first in line to take it...
1/1	I‚Äôm not sure how long it‚Äôll take to get to young people like myself, but I‚Äôm looking forward to getting it and being able to live my life.
0/-1	I‚Äôm not sure how to feel anymore and that hurts
1/1	I‚Äôm not sure why you are so determined to find reasons why the vaccine does not work. There is clear evidence that it does work. The stuff you sent makes no point at all, because most of Israel is not yet vaccinated.
0/0	I‚Äôm not taking it , inject to the makers of that vaccine first
0/0	I‚Äôm not taking it. Why because operation warp speed is entirely too fast. I am not willing to put me or my children through it knowing that my children and i have allergies. Not only that i just don‚Äôt really trust the medical industry for personal reasons.
0/0	I‚Äôm not taking the vaccine. Vaccines are literally Government Sponsored Eugenics programs to make people sick and reduce their cognitive abilities.
0/0	I‚Äôm not your guinea pig, maybe you are but I‚Äôm not.
0/0	I‚Äôm now an anti-vaxxer but a vaccine developed in 6-12 months is giving me doubts.
1/1	I‚Äôm okay waiting. But as soon as it‚Äôs available I‚Äôll sign up immediately.
1/1	I‚Äôm on immune suppressant medication (Azathioprine) and had the Oxford Vaccine. I had a sore arm and the chills for 2 days but then I was fine. The jab is safe and it‚Äôs best to be protected.
0/0	I‚Äôm over 50, and it‚Äôs a firm No from me.
1/1	I‚Äôm past day 3 on moderna no side affects sore arm is getting better I will keep you updated
1/1	I‚Äôm praying that the vaccine will work and praying for a better 2021
1/1	I‚Äôm pretty sure getting the vaccine is better/less risky than getting the virus
0/0/0/0	I‚Äôm quitting my job if they require me to take it.
0/0	I‚Äôm refusing it, I don‚Äôt need it, I don‚Äôt trust this crooked government I‚Äôve broke every rule and have never felt better, let me live my life.
1/-1	I‚Äôm right in line after the Queen of England
1/1	I‚Äôm right there with you, Mayim! I haven‚Äôt taken the flu vaccine in years and I did not have my kids take it either. But last year I did. I, too, made my own vaccination schedule for both of my boys. I will be getting the COVID vaccine ASAP! And will be having my boys get it, too.
0/0	I‚Äôm scared they will force me to take the vaccine while I‚Äôm pregnant.. I just don‚Äôt feel that they know enough right now about the long term side effects of this yet. I will refuse it until more time has passed.
0/0	I‚Äôm scared to get injected because of these ‚Äúallergic reaction‚Äù allegations all over the media!
0/0/0	I‚Äôm sceptical about it due to how fast it‚Äôs been developed, I‚Äôm more worried about long term effects
0/-1	I‚Äôm shocked about people saying they had terrible side effects but were happy! I‚Äôve had HaHb/YelF/Tetanus/ & other inoculations in the past NONE ever gave me trouble but the Covid vaccine I‚Äôm hearing a diff story...is it because it‚Äôs Gene therapy and not a traditional vaccine?
1/1	I‚Äôm so glad I got my vaccine. I had symptoms after the second dose and it was a rough 12 hours, but I‚Äôd planned the day off. I had Gatorade and Tylenol at the ready, and 36 hours after the vaccine I felt perfectly normal. Later that day I took a 5 mile walk! I work at my hospital‚Äôs covid vaccine clinic, and a lot of people are back at work and feeling fine the day after their vaccine.
1/1	I‚Äôm so glad I got vaccination yesterday..
1/-1	I‚Äôm so glad this video exist now I can explain to my friends and family why it was so fast
1/1	I‚Äôm so happy I pushed myself this week with my workout and work! I got the 2nd covid-19 vaccine on Thursday and was so sick with every side-effect. I only missed one workout on Friday! So I count that as a win!!
1/1	I‚Äôm so happy you made this video! I can‚Äôt wait till I can get vaccinated and help continue to do my part thank you for everything you‚Äôre doing! Stay safe!!
1/1	I‚Äôm so proud of our @A2schools nurses for giving vaccine shots to special ed (self contained) classroom teachers today. Their calm & reassuring words helped everyone!
1/1	I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss but please understand that it is still possible to contact COVID after the first vaccine. You have to get the second one for reliable immunity. Her death was from COVID, not the vaccine. It is impossible to contract Covid from the vaccine. I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss but please don‚Äôt put your own life at risk out of grief.
1/1	I‚Äôm so thankful that I am in the number of vaccinated.
1/1	I‚Äôm so very fortunate to be in a job/position that allowed for access to the COVID-19 vaccine. I am so thankful and after nearly a year of worry, RELIEVED
1/0	I‚Äôm sorry but are people being contrarian for the sake of it? Does anyone actually have a problem with mandatory vaccinations?
1/1	I‚Äôm surprised people are skeptical about the vaccine. I‚Äôm the only one at my work said I‚Äôll be down taking once it is available to us.
1/1	I‚Äôm taking mine in a few weeks, I know it will be a huge relief when they have both shots.
1/1	I‚Äôm taking my parents to get their first shots tmrw (Moderna) and can‚Äôt wait. Today, three managers (also seniors) I work with got their shots today.
1/1	I‚Äôm taking the vaccine since a lot of people do.
1/1	I‚Äôm thrilled to say that I got my first COVID vaccine dose today! College Station opened its vaccine hub today (which works great!) and I got the call as someone in phase 1b So proud to do my part to prevent the spread of COVID-19! #VaccinesWork
1/1	I‚Äôm tired of so many people saying they get sick from getting such and such vaccine so they don‚Äôt get it. Getting a little achy or sore means your immune system worked and you will likely be safer now.
0/0	I‚Äôm trusting my immune system against the 99% virus.
1/1	I‚Äôm vaccinated!
1/1	I‚Äôm very compromised and will be high on the list for the vaccine in Canada. I‚Äôve been scared. I‚Äôm less so now.
1/1	I‚Äôm very glad you got it! I a CAT scan tech in the same boat. It‚Äôs been a very long year. I was supposed to have gotten my vaccine yesterday but Tuesday I tested positive for covid. Survived 10 months just to get it 5 days before my vaccine lol. Terrible luck. On the upside, I‚Äôm doing ok. I‚Äôm pretty sure I got it from work as my and my wife literally do nothing else so I hope everyone on the frontline can get it ASAP.
1/1	I‚Äôm very pro science, pro doctor (pro vaccine) etc. But we have to be willing to admit past failures.
0/0	I‚Äôm willing to be part of the control group that doesn‚Äôt get the vaccine!
1/1	I‚Äôm willing to take the minute it is available so that I can live a normal life soon and hopefully trigger others in my circle to follow suit.
0/0	I‚Äôm with Craig on this and so is more than 50% of Australians. The vaccine is misinformation and dangerous , good luck being a GMO! Kill Gates openly admits it! seriously I am shocked how misinformed politicians are, either that or they‚Äôre just following orders?
0/1	I‚Äôm worried about getting coronavirus whilst getting the vaccine
0/-1	I‚Äôm worried of a multi dose vaccine being drawn up correctly in the syringe. In particular if none medical staff are giving this injection. Accuracy is absolutely important. Too much could kill, not enough is no good.
0/0	I‚Äôm young and I‚Äôm healthy and I have no pre-existing conditions and I‚Äôm not taking that damn vaccine
0/0	I‚Äôve Never received the flu shot and will not be receiving covid shot either! I‚Äôm not worried about a cough; I‚Äôm worried about a cop! More blacks are being killed by cops not Covid!!

0	I‚Äôve been feeling extremely tired all yesterday and today and I slept for 10 hours last night only to find out that it‚Äôs a side effect of the vaccine bruh I have a quiz on Monday I need to study for
1/1	I‚Äôve been shielding and received my Covid jab, I currently have the chills, a headache , I‚Äôm tired but can‚Äôt sleep, I feel ill but it‚Äôs worth it. I know it‚Äôs my immune system working hard. To those who don‚Äôt want to get it, fine. But don‚Äôt spoil it for us.
1/1	I‚Äôve been vaccinated. One step closer to a normal life I hope
0/-1	I‚Äôve gotten a flu vaccine, A month ago and I feel like I‚Äôm going to regret it. I just learned how bad the flu vaccine was after I got it. I‚Äôm spiritual and have been aware of the toxic covid 19 vaccine. Honesty I don‚Äôt feel like my usual self. I am currently detoxing from it. Should I just let go of this fear? I really hope I have not messed up my DNA.

1/1	Just get the vaccine! The sooner everyone gets it the sooner we out of this Pandemic!
1/1	Just got it today!Ok, so as a healthcare worker, I will admit that I feel something of an obligation to get the shot, if only to help protect the patients I interact with every day. But, beyond that, as a pharmacist who has read the EUA‚Äôs (emergency use authorizations) for both the Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccines, I can tell you I have a lot of confidence in both of these vaccines. Confidence that they are safe, and confidence that they work really well to prevent me from getting (and transmitting) COVID-19.

1/1	Just got my first corona vaccine. Things are looking up!
1/1	Just got my first dose of the Moderna vaccine today. Everything went fine. Just some slight burning and a slight cold feeling in my arm during the vaccination. My arm is getting more sore as the day goes on.
1/1	Just got my first dose today!
1/1	Just got my first dose yesterday. Honestly for side effects all I've had is some arm pain but that should be anticipated with any vaccine. I would encourage people to take it as I got it and I'm perfectly alright. As the video explained ( if you watched it ) that the vaccine makes your body produce the spike protein so if you ever do catch Coronavirus your body should fight it off. I'm going to get my second dose on 2/11/21. What I think is messed up is people fearing the one thing that could end the pandemic than the virus itself.
1/1	Just got my first vaccine shot today at work
1/1	Just got my second dose of phizer today. Soo, so excited to have probably gotten through this pandemic covidfree

1/-1	Just look back in history in 1952 at polio a record year for polio 57,628 people got polio there is no proof vaccines make people sick or kill people. And for the vaccines cause autism is total crap as person who is on the autism spectrum and can we all remember the doctor who said vaccines caused autism it was found out that the doctor lied on his medical papers about his findings on autism was caused by vaccines let's ask people all the familys of the people who died from polio or people who got polio lived if the polio vaccine is a lie
0/-1	Just met my next door neighbour who has had the Corona jab and the flu jab and she said both her and her husband have had a chesty cold since before Christmas. This happens to them every year after the flu jab. Talk about doing the same thing over and over expecting a different outcome. Some years they have been really bad and why they do it is beyond me. Pumping yourself full of man made vaccines can not do your natural immune system any good in fact it could ultimately destroy it.
0/1	Just note how remarkable has been the development process for vaccines. This normally takes years or many many months: we now have 3 tested vaccine candidates at advanced trials stage
0/0	Just passing this on I have carefully studied the development of the covid vaccines and many things about them are very concerning to me: First of all, up until this point there has never been any successful vaccine for coronaviruses in humans due to a problem typical of coronavirus vaccine development called antibody dependent enhancement or ADE. [1] In preliminary animal trials for previous coronavirus vaccines (SARS and MERS), animals were vaccinated and seemed to exhibit a robust antibody response, but upon exposure to the wild virus, they developed a paradoxical immune enhancement leading to severe organ inflammation (especially in lungs), and they died. [2][3] Paradoxical immune response in coronavirus vaccines has also taken place in human trials, which occurred during testing of the failed RSV vaccines of the 1950s. [4] Alarmingly, there are some statistical indications of ADE in covid vaccine trials, but there is no way to know for sure because many key signifiers of ADE weren‚Äôt specifically addressed. [5] Due to emergency protocol, the usual method of testing animals prior to humans was bypassed, limited animal testing occurred in parallel with humans, and the potential for ADE was not comprehensively assessed. [6] [7] Historical precedent would suggest, however, that ADE is a distinct possibility, and we may not know the true negative effects until years from now when vaccinated persons are exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or genetically similar versions of coronavirus. [8] Second, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines contain lipid nanoparticles that are ‚ÄúPEGylated‚Äù, meaning the nanoparticles are coated with PEG (polyethylene glycol).[9] PEGs can lead to life threatening anaphylaxis or other conditions such as thrombocytopenia. [10] [50] Such reactions are already occurring during the initial vaccine rollout and PEGs are the most likely culprit. [11] Approximately 72% of the US population have PEG antibodies, with 8% having extremely elevated levels (more than 500 ng/mL), putting them at risk for severe allergic reaction and/or future autoimmune disorders. [12] These reactions were totally predictable, with many experts warning of the danger posed by PEGs [13][14][15], yet participants with a history of severe allergic reaction were excluded from the trials, serving to obscure the actual negative impact PEGs will have now that these vaccines are being given to members of the public who have not been screened for PEG antibodies. [16] Also, there is some worrying evidence to suggest that PEGs cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain, possibly causing inflammation and/or autoimmune conditions, a fact gleaned from previous animal studies on mRNA vaccines. PEGs were found to be distributed across a spectrum of tissues including the brain. [52] Additionally, nanoparticles (such as PEGylated hydrogel) are known components for state of the art medical interventions, including biosurveillance technology currently being developed by DARPA and companies like Profusa Inc. [17][18][19][20][21] The secretive nature of this technology necessitates a knowledge gap between developers and the general public, so although my research efforts have yet to verify a direct functional relationship between PEGylated nanoparticles used in covid vaccines and biosurveillance, I personally do not relish the prospect of being injected with such given their association with biosurveillance technology of the military industrial complex. Third, it is impossible to ascertain long term safety because of the foreshortened timeframe of Operation Warp Speed. [22] Vaccines should be tested for multiple years to adequately assess their longterm effects. [23] Short term safety is questionable too, as much of the data is still unavailable, and the current reports on safety and efficacy essentially amount to self-reported press releases from these companies themselves. [24] Fourth, the efficacy number of 90% for Pfizer and 94% for Moderna is statistically misleading, reporting a relative reduction instead of absolute reduction of risk*. Also, the trials only assessed these vaccines‚Äô ability to prevent mild symptoms and NOT their ability to prevent transmission. [25] If they don‚Äôt prevent people from transmitting the virus (especially when safer, cheaper drugs like Ivermectin do) [26] [27] what‚Äôs the point? Fifth, these are NOT vaccines in the normal sense. They are mRNA vaccines, which utilize a completely different process for achieving disease protection**; mRNA vaccines seek to introduce messenger RNA into the body in order to ‚Äútrick‚Äù cells into producing immunogens, which then stimulate an immune response. [28] These vaccines are the first of their kind ever to gain authorization. [29] Current vaccinations are essentially an extension of phase 3 of the trials. [30] Because of the lack of long term safety assessment and the new nature of this technology, people are participating in a mass human experiment with no way of knowing the long term health effects these could cause. Many problems from vaccines are known to have an incubatory period and do not manifest until much later, which is why testing needs to occur for multiple years in order to adequately assess risk. [31] One such problem currently being discussed is the mRNA technology‚Äôs possible impact on female fertility, as it encourages the production of antibodies against a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that contains a very similar protein crucial for the development of placenta called syncytin-1. This could interfere with the reproductive process by encouraging the immune system to react against syncytin-1, thereby disrupting placental development. [32] The vaccines‚Äô impact on fertility is currently unknown as animal reproductive toxicity studies have not been completed. [33] Sixth, there was a signature for many different problems seen in the various trials and initial rollout for these vaccines, problems that are concurrent with commonly documented vaccine injuries. Injuries that did occur in the various trials/rollout have included, but are not limited to, anaphylaxis, Bell‚Äôs palsy, transverse myelitis, multi-system inflammatory syndrome, encephalomyelitis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, and death. [34] [35] [36] [37] [50] [51] Seventh, and perhaps most importantly, the movement toward potential vaccine mandates or other coercive policies violates humanity‚Äôs most universally accepted principles of human rights and medical ethics, especially for a medical intervention with so many known and unknown safety/efficacy concerns. The absolute bedrock of medical ethics is the right to informed consent, as individuals must be made fully aware of all the potential benefits and risks associated with a medical intervention, while still maintaining the right to decline that intervention should they so choose. [41] Mandates or coercive measures fundamentally violate historical safeguards humanity has put in place to protect us from the ever present threat of medical tyranny, including the Nuremberg Code, the United Nations‚Äô International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and UNESCO‚Äôs Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights. [42] [43] [49] Such would also be in violation of the Hippocratic Oath, for not only do oath keepers pledge first to do no harm, but also to treat the needs of the patient. [44] This implies that a doctor‚Äôs duty primarily pertains to the needs of the individual before the needs of the collective, a vital distinction made by Hippocrates and understood for nearly 2 millennia. [45] [46] Privileging the needs of the collective is a ‚Äúfallacy of misplaced concreteness‚Äù. [47] While individual need is directly apprehensible and consensual, collective need is an abstract, subjective concept not easily defined. And yet who usually gets to define this concept? Such is most often defined by those in power with the most means to influence institutional narratives, turning medical professionals who treat the needs of the collective according to this definition into mere extensions of that power at the expense of individual informed consent.

0/0	Let me just recap this more simply - mRNA will transcribe onto your cells part of the genoma related to a protein unique to Covid-19. It will "instruct" your cells into producing it and that - in theory, but sadly there's not data on long term effects of this doing - should trigger the production of antibodies to fight it. Pity that because your own immune system will be creating that protein which your antibodies will then have to fight, it will be as if you had acquired an auto-immune disease. Your cells are not designed to produce any "foreign" protein, especially that of viruses. You can have it, and good luck with it!

1/1	Like anything that you put in your body, there could be potential side effects or allergic reactions. However, the majority of people don‚Äôt have any issues after getting vaccinated. If they did, they most likely recovered quickly and aren‚Äôt suffering from any long-term issues.
0/0	Like we're going to trust a doctor (totally bias) with a big booze cart behind him.

0/0	Literally just recovered from COVID19 a few days ago, no reason to take it. Heck, I'd sooner get it again (knowing what I know now regarding how to fight it) then take the vaccine.

0/0	Lmfaoooo! The safest way to protect yourself from viral illnesses is to eat the right diet, workout, expose yourself to germs, and develop a strong immune system with vitamins and supplements. Not taking a chemical ridden vaccine. Sad!
1/1	Lockdown is & will continue to be hard - can empathise with those comments. Conspiracy theorists - there will always be a few! Very happy with progress made so far, sticking to the correct JCVI priorities & our increasing numbers this week. Hope to get my vaccine letter soon!

1/1	Long-term effect of covid is worse! I will take the vaccine for sure.
0/1	Look I‚Äôm pro vax my kids get em but I won‚Äôt be getting a covid vaccine. They need to work out the kinks first. But you go head and test it. I was reading an article that a few people got Bell‚Äôs palsy. It‚Äôs just unknown and scary.
1/1	Look people if you don‚Äôt wanna get the vaccine that‚Äôs ok. But don‚Äôt you dare get in the way of those of us who do. That‚Äôs just wrong in all kinds of ways. It‚Äôs not your right to make that choice for me or anyone else. I you wanna start being that way then let some of us make decisions for you. Don‚Äôt do to others what you don‚Äôt want done to you!
0/1	Look, don't take the vaccine, no skin of anyone's nose if you take your chances and then contract the virus. If you were unfortunate enough to react badly to the virus I'm sure you'd want to refuse oxygen or medical help too, which would be only fair.

1/1/1/1	Lot's of things have happened in the last 45 days. Please do an update. EUA for the Pfizer is expected on 15 Nov. BTW, I will take it as soon as possible.
0/0	Lots of drugs approved by the FDA and tested for far longer periods of time end up developing serious and lethal side effects, if not immediately then years down the road.
1/1	Lots of love and respect to the science community. The media focuses a lot on crappy influencers, royals, actors and actresses , sports people but they forget about the people working anonymously to save and protect lives.
1/-1	Lots of people: I really want a Covid vaccine, but I‚Äôm a little uneasy about how fast the process has gone & I want to know it‚Äôs a safe vaccine that‚Äôs been properly vetted. Also lots of people: THREE WHOLE WEEKS TO READ 100s OF PAGES OF TRIAL DATA? WHY IS THE FDA LAZING AROUND?
1/1	Love science

1/1	Love this. Let's keep it up!
0/1/0	Lovely, the more side effects I get the better it is working. Great encouragement for the Sheeple to have the V-cine.
1/1	Luckily the Covid vaccine is not like others because the researchers did not have to struggle for years trying to get funded. Also, unlike most trials there was no shortage of volunteers to test it on. Also, researchers had started working a similar vaccine years before so much of the preliminary work was already done. Also, because of ridiculously lavish funding, they did not have to write up proposals and get approval every few months to keep research running. They were able to work fast not because of cutting corners of lack of testing but because they actually had the money they needed and prior work had already been done.
1/1	Lucky to be vaccinated tomorrow..
1/1	Lucky to get my vaccine in Arizona because they are allowing teachers early access.
1	Lucky to have it done on Tuesday. Looking forward to it.

0/0	Man-made Vaccine to "cure" a man-made Disease. I know Genocide when I smell it, and this smells like Genocide . DISLIKE
0/1	Managing a vaccine at -70¬∞C is too massive a challenge not just for India, but, for any country with a tropical climate. Europe & North America can have the Pfizer vaccine, the rest of the world needs the likes of Oxford, COVAXIN, SPUTNIK-V..etc.(cost effective and easy to store)
1/1	Many health agencies across the globe have found the vaccine to be safe. The benefits of the vaccine are not only preventing infection for yourself (thus preventing your own death and long term health effects from covid), but also should include slowing the spread of covid and preventing you from transmitting it others.
0/-1	Many of you have also asked if you already have natural antibodies in your system, is this new vaccine better for those who‚Äôve already had covid?

0/0	Many vaccines are tested for years on animals before tried on the public. My concern with the new mRNA vaccines, which have not been tested for years in animals first, is that there is a possibility that in a year or two, there is a possibility that these mRNA vaccines could cause our own cells to become cancerous.
1/0	Many vaccines have a day of aches while our immune systems respond and learn how to conquer the virus. I've never experienced anything that couldn't be fixed with an ibuprofen.

1/1	Mayors, governors, the President, etc. should be vaccinated immediately. Regardless of their political beliefs its critical that the people running our governments are healthy and on the job. Remember what happened when Trump got sick? The Government went into free fall and there was serious concerns about who was making critical decisions. You don't want that even on a state or local level.

1/1	Me and my children are going to get the vaccine.
1/1	Me and my coworkers in the hospital will be finally able to get vaccinated. Leaving your home everyday to go to work knowing that you can get infected anytime is very scary, since we are running low on PPE. I'm tired mentally and physically and last month we had a meeting that we had to prepare for a next wave! Oh God when is this going to end?!!!
1/1	Me and my family are all getting vaccinated and guess what? Millions of people have gotten vaccinated and 99.999 percent of those people are fine. Stop spreading fear with your lies.
1/1	Me and my family have received both doses of the vaccine and we‚Äôre grateful for it. I‚Äôve lost two friends to COVID-19 in 2020 and I don‚Äôt want to loose anymore. The vaccine is here to protect you and your loved ones. These conspiracy theories are ridiculous. Literally every vaccine ever has been created in a lab just like this one
0/0	Me taking it won't protect someone else's life. I'm a young guy in his 20s so the vaccine most likely won't save my life either. It might make it a more pleasant experience, but its not worth the risk of the hangover side effects. Human trials need 2 years to properly research potential long term effects anyway
1/1	Me too can‚Äôt wait till the 25th for my second dose!

0/0	Moderna have never produced vaccines, they are a Gene Therapy Company
1/1	Moderna is a smaller drug company so he needs to license his vaccine to the much larger drug companies like Merck et al! POTUS-46 should use the War Production Act to make more vaccine stocks. including starting today making the J & J single dose. which is more stable. That means it needs less temperature control. a great factor to more rural areas around the country!
0/0	Moderna vaccine = Gates vaccine. No way in hell take it. From the guy who says we need to depopulate and figure out a way to get people ready to not work anymore. Then the one group the virus targets is seniors All he needs is a chip in you.

1/1	Most important job of the year was just completed. Taking this young lady to get her first vaccine at the City College campus! By far one of the most important moments we've shared together.
1/-1	Most of my coworkers and family are either antivax or narcissists and will not get vaccinated.
1/1	Most of the vaccines are targeting the spike protein, which is the protein the virus uses to enter cells. Although the virus doesn't appear to be mutating rapidly it's possible the spike could mutate. In fact the spike already mutated in mink in Denmark. One thing that's great about the Oxford vaccine and the mRNA vaccines is that they can quickly be edited to protect against a different form of the spike if necessary so a new form of the vaccine could be developed super fast rather than starting from scratch.
0/0	Most of these vaccines are faked...the plungers are in or empty and the needles are not going into the arm.
0/0	Most of those smeared as anti-vaxxers have no problem with a vaccine per se. What they do have is a problem with vaccination by coercion, and any future requirement to show evidence of vaccination to partake in normal life; via some app or e-certificate. Once this is normalised, it's a few short steps to a Chinese-style social control system. Even some distinguished politicians are worried.

1/1	My MD said it was up to me if I wanted to get vaccinated since I might not mount a sufficient immune response. Since the vaccine is made of mRNA instead of actual virus, my doctor wasn‚Äôt worried about it making me sick. So far I‚Äôve gotten my first dose last week and feel fine.

0/0	My brother first child is not vaccinated at all. 3,5 years but he has the mind of an 8 year old. Not only does he speak Swedish his native tunge, but also is learning english via Youtube on the iPad. The other day I heard him singing "happy birthday" in Arabic, he must have learned at daycare.. He's a very healthy boy full of life. These unvaccinated children will change the world!
1/-1	My child is dying of polio, but thank god he's not autistic!
0/0	My concern is by sending a message to your cells to replicate the "spike" and then to later attack that spike could be setting our bodies up for autoimmune disease
1/0	My concern is going to a vaccination site and then getting the virus there before the vaccine can kick in or getting the virus before the 2nd shot
0/0	My conscience says do not take the vaccine
1/0	My cousin is antivax and has had 3 children. All of them have autism.
1/1	My coworker flipped from not wanting it at all to wanting it today after I spoke with him mid December. It is so refreshing knowing peoples stance isn‚Äôt necessarily in stone
1/1	My current actual guess is that the best current coronavirus vaccines, like Moderna's, probably actually work, are probably safe, and ought to be for sale right now to anyone who wants to be part of the experimental group. #ChangeMyView #ButPleaseCiteStatisticsToDoSo
0/0/0	My current expectation is NO, however I live in Australia, where COVID-19 is virtually eradicated.
1/1	My dad and his wife yesterday too! Within a couple of weeks my whole family should be vaccinated (other than me, I‚Äôll be at the end). It‚Äôs a really good feeling.
1/1	My dad died from Covid, my wife is a mortician and has many ppl in her cooler because of this virus. My mom almost died and still has effects. I hope everyone does it, wish my dad had a few months for it to have came out.

1/1	My dad recently passed away due to covid, and it pains me to see people not taking this seriously
1/1	My dad said he didn‚Äôt quite feel himself for a couple of days but nothing major. Like he said ... I‚Äôd rather this than catching covid.
1/1	My dad was ill for around 2-3 days but he is definitely better right now. He said that it‚Äôs normal for people to get ill for a few days after a vaccination.

0/0	My daughter works in an elderly facility. Three days ago they vaccinated the residents and 4 in her ward alone fell deathly ill. One had a heart attack. Many people in fact have died from this madman vaccine. Covid is a hoax and the vaccine will kill you. Don't be stupid.
1/1	My distinctly non-religious Dad will be going to church on a Sunday morning for the first time in my life this week. For his COVID vaccination. I couldn't be happier.
0/0	My doctors wife was 8 days hospitalized after the second dose.
1/1	My elderly mom got her 1st shot yesterday and is doing well..was the mederna brand
1/1	My elderly parents and sister just did last week. Arm pain and trouble sleeping due to the arm pain but otherwise we're okay. It cleared up fast. 2nd Pfizer shot had more reaction. Moderna seems more pleasant.

1/1	My father got vaccinated the other day. Good for him
1/1	My father(a doctor) got vaccinated yesterday and he has been ill ever since. I‚Äôm honestly getting more skeptical of this vaccine because there have been many cases of people dying because of the vaccine. UPDATE: My dad was ill for around 2-3 days but he is definitely better right now. He said that it‚Äôs normal for people to get ill for a few days after a vaccination. So don‚Äôt worry about the Covid vaccine...
1/-1	My fever hit 101 a few hours ago so I took 500mg Tylenol. Feeling better. Drinking lots & was able to eat something. I have no regrets though. I would rather go through 24 hours of feeling ill vs getting covid.
1/-1	My first Modena dose only gave me a sore arm. My second dose gave me chills, headaches and a slight fever for a day.
1/1	My friend did the covid19 vaccine yesterday and had no side effects.. I will do it too!
1/0	My friend got the shot and tested positive for covid. Hasn't been sick in 10 years until the vaccine.

1/1	My friendd had the vaccine recently and she said she didn't have any reaction. It was fine.
0/0	My friends girlfriend got it and woke up paralyzed the next day!!! Good luck with the experimental vaccine
1/1	My friends younger sister had a temporarily weakened immune system due to treatment for her skin, and she caught chicken pox from an unvaccinated kid who had gone to school without knowing he had it. This is a less extreme case but it shows how easily people‚Äôs choices effect everyone else.
1/1	My girlfriend received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine. And about a week or two after the second dose, she had contact with a positive patient at her hospital before they knew the patient had COVID. They called her in to do a nasal swab and the test came back negative. Take that for whatever you will. Its not guaranteed that she would've gotten sick without the vaccine. But I knew eventually this would happen. I knew that some day eventually she would be exposed without an N95/negative pressure room. And potentially drag it home.
1/1	My grandad has finally had his first Covid vaccine injection. It took long enough to get his turn but hopefully he‚Äôll be more protected if he needs to leave the house anytime
1/1	My grandmother for her first phizer vaccine today and is doing very well so far.
1/1	My grandmother got her vaccine a few weeks ago, and she‚Äôs doing well, all she got from taking the vaccine was a mild fever. It‚Äôs fine.

1/1	My hospital gets our first batch next week and I‚Äôll probably get vaccinated in 2 weeks. Stoked. Hopefully no side effects.
1/1	My husband 75 and I at 69 took Moderna vaccine 2 weeks ago. We are looking forward to having 2nd vaccine in 2 weeks. Zero side effects

1/1	My husband and I will be getting the vaccine just as soon as we are contacted by our health care provider that it is available.
1	My husband and his coworker just waited in line for over 4 hours but they both got their first dose of the COVID vaccine!
1/1	My husband got covid! He was really sick. I want the vaccine!!!!
1/1	My husband got his appointment through for tomorrow. I know more than a few who have had their vaccinations. Well done NHS.
1/1	My husband had Covid in March and almost died. He is still on oxygen. It's a terrible virus. I will get the shot when it becomes available.
1/1	My husband is in the Oxford trial. He had a strong 36 hour reaction to the first shot but nothing to the second shot. Anecdotally that seems par for the course for that one. I think it's different for every vaccine and every person.
1/1	My idiot husband is a CT tech and is refusing to get it right now. Wants to wait to see how it goes. I'm an SLP at a hospital and I get it on Wednesday. Unfortunately, he sees 20x the amount of COVID patients I do.
1/0	My immune system does a whole lot better...without all the side effects.
0/0	My immune system is 99.998 percent effective after 50 years. It will never be compromised by this poison. Ever.

1/1	My in-laws have their covid vaccine tomorrow (at @RJAH_NHS , I'm pleased to say!) and my parents, in the over-65s group, will hopefully be seen by the end of the month. It's such a relief to see those closest to us getting protection
0/0	My job is offering the vaccine on Thursday. I told them you will have to hold me down if you expect me to take it
0/0	My kid is perfectly healthy and he had no polio vaccine.
1/1	My lovely in-laws got their covid vaccine today! I know how much it means to them - and have seen how much it means to the thousands of people who have been vaccinated across Shropshire, Telford & Wrekin. It's definitely a career highlight to be a small part of it.
1/1	My main concern is not whether or not I get infected, but whether I spread it to someone less fortunate.
0/0	My main issue it was rushed to the market for something that you have over a 99% survival rate. I‚Äôm not one of those the government is trying to chip us I just feel that I don‚Äôt want to be a Guenia pig to this vaccine
0/0	My mindset is just to be last person in the country to get the vaccine. It would be selfish to deny someone the vaccine by being vaccinated ahead of anyone when supply is so limited. I figure 20+ years from now I might be within 10 years of being on a 5 year waiting list for the vaccine. But I will give up my place in line to the person behind me out of politeness.
1/1	My mom and all her friends are Facebook researchers and I‚Äôll never forget this one lady saying ‚Äúwhy do we even need vaccines, like, there hasn‚Äôt been a measles breakout in decades‚Äù like yes??? Because people were being vaccinated ü§¶üèΩ‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚ôÄÔ∏è people who spend ten minutes on google and think they have a better grasp on medical things than doctors that have spent years studying medicine never fail to make my blood boil

1/-1	My mom didn‚Äôt get my vaccine very often and I always got sick, but recently she became full antivaxx that I now have to rely on my dad to help me get my vaccine. So antivaxx moms can say oh props to your mom, shut up, I recently got the flu because I didn‚Äôt get the vaccine it was horrible don‚Äôt put your kid through it!!!

0/0	My mom has SEVERE arthritis simply from a flu vaccine
0/0	My mom has said that she doesn‚Äôt want to take the COVID 19 vaccine. She says this is because the vaccine has ‚Äúkilled almost everyone who took it‚Äù.
0/0	My mom in LB received a whatsapp list of 10 categories who should not receive covid vaccine. It includes very random categories, like those with high blood pressure. As far as I know, only pregnant women are advised against it, or am I missing something?
1/-1	My mom in New York got hers. Honestly, she is who i was worried about. I'm young and I can handle the virus.
1/1	My mom is a nurse. When some of her fellow nurses received the first dose of Pfizer and Moderna, it was so effective that they didn't get covid even when their entire family tested positive. Mind you the 1st dose only give you 50% protection. These two mRNA vaccines are revolutionizing vaccine technology and have no real competition
1/0	My mom telling me conspiracy theories that the Covid vaccine will make me infertile. Like ok??? Two for one deal???
1/1	My mom texted me that she and my dad got their first COVID vaccine today. I never thought somebody getting a shot would make me happy.
1/1	My mom was able to get it though. No signs of autism, but side effects included her cussing at the NFL game.
1/1	My mom, 74, but having been through 2 bouts of cancer so is at higher risk, just got her 1st vaccine Syringe dose (she lives in Oceanside, California). OMG the relief!! Folded hands #VaccinesWork

1/1	My mother has MS. Her immune system is severely weakened as a result. Today she got her COVID vaccine. Today I am very thankful.
1/1	My mother in #PuertoRico got her second dose of the #COVID19 #vaccine today. She is also helping other older adults to get vaccinated. I cannot be happier.
1/1	My mother received her second dose about a week ago, and it feels like a huge weight off my shoulders.
0/0	My mother's neighbor, a healthy oncologist, had a brain aneurysm within a week of getting his vaccine. He died a few days later. No news report with him or investigation to see if his death was related to the vaccine. Just saying, there could be more unreported cases of this (or similar deaths) occuring.
0/0	My mother‚Äôs healthcare place called to get permission to give my 90-year-old mother one of the vaccines and I said no way
0/0	My motto is: No mask No Shutdowns No test, trace nor chip And they can take that poisonous vax and shove it up their butts

1/1	My mum got her Covid-19 vaccine today and I could not be happier
1/1	My mum had her first Covid jab today. Thank you #Science and thank you to the @NHS and all the volunteers helping to run the #vaccination programme. So grateful
1/1	My mum has had her vaccination...very happy. #CovidVaccine #AstraZeneca
1/0	My mum just had covid, and my auntie has it at the moment. It is people like you who are responsible for children losing their parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. Shame on you - listen to science.
1/1	My old folks got it a week ago, going back in a couple weeks for round 2. Huge weight off my mind.
0/0	My only issue with taking it is whether it‚Äôs safe. Has safety been compromised due to the rush to get it out.
1/1	My opinion that appears to piss off everyone I know. I think if a parent doesn't vaccinate their kid then it should be an issue for CPS.
1/1	My other half just booked in for his jabs - there is a 12 week gap between first and second.
1/1/1/1	My overall opinion on vaccines is that they are good :D
1/1	My parents (aged 72 and 74) just had their first dose of Pfizer vaccine!!
1/1/1	My parents always made sure I got the vaccinations that were necessary as a kid and I'm really glad they did.

1/1	My parents both got their first #COVID19 vaccine today. Such a relief.

1/1	My parents vaccinated me. Now I'm an adult.
1/1	My partner is fully vaccinated against COVID. Words cannot describe how much relief I feel. I'm hoping it's my turn in the next couple months.
1/1	My personal opinion is that you should get the vaccine if it's offered to you. You're right the system is broken (corrupt governments etc), but you won't fix the system by skipping the vaccine. You passing up the vaccine won't necessarily mean it goes to someone who needs it more-- most likely it'll go to someone else who is in your same position (a friend of a politician who doesn't need it the most).
0/0	My question is, how is it acceptable that the virus vaccine had been discovered immediately and is not a threat to human life while HIV aids had been there for decades without a vaccine to immune rhe human body form HIV? ü§¶‚ôÄÔ∏èFear the evil behind such vaccine. ‚õî‚ùå
0/-1	My question is, will the world be free from viruses after being vaccinated? Secondly, if this vaccine is good, why do you have to promote it, good things should not need promotion, automatically people will come together, let alone free.
1/1	My reaction is relief and joy. It appears worldwide prayers have been answered.
1/1	My reaction to those who refuse the vaccine is fine, more for the rest of us!
1/1/1	My sister had a reaction to a vaccine and can't get certain ones. She's still pro-vaccine.
0/0	My sister is a nurse and one of my friends AND they will NOT take this vaccine! Me neither!!!!!
1/1	My sleeve is rolled up.
0/0	My son developed autistic symptoms after receiving his 3rd grade vaccines. He was a happy child before that. Now he is non social and non communicative. Fortunately it's mild so he can function but I'm disgusted with people who hide and deny that this is happening. It's common sense that you don't inject chemicals into your body. Have you read the ingredient list in vaccines?
0/0	My son got the measles from MMR vaccine üíâ. My family got the flu from the free flu shot üíâ. And we will not be submitted to this evil.

1/1	My state has started allowing pregnant people and people with qualifying medical conditions to start signing up so I just completed the form to request an appointment tonight! It might be a bit before I actually get my vaccine but I'm excited to be a step closer!
0/0	My trust issues said no
0/0	My understanding is that you have maybe a 2% or less chance of dying from it if you catch it, which means around 98% survival rate. So help me somebody, or isn't just taking your chances around 10% better than the vaccines? Maybe my brains is not working fast enough, not sure.
0/-1	My whole family don't use vaccine until it's been used and successful in short my fam doesn't want to take vaccines that are literally just made
1/1	My wife & I got our Covid-19 vaccine today! No negative reaction at all.

1/1	My wife is getting her second dose of the Moderna vaccine this Wednesday! I only hope that I too can get vaccinated shortly!
1/1	My wife is in healthcare transporting covid positive patients every day. She comes home and is so exhausted. We are both so excited to know that this is on the horizon and know it's coming soon
0/0	My wife is pregnant, I don't want to let them vaccine my child, how should I proceed? Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.
1/1	Myself, I am entusiastic about the vaccin and will definitely take it. I want to be able to visit my grandchildren in England. I am also thankful that the British will lead and test the vaccin on the elderly in care homes in massive roll-out. This way, the rest of Europe will know if it is safe for the very old and vulnerable when we start our campaigns a month from now. Thank you!

0/0	Never had a flu, shingles or pneumonia vaccine (and no, I've not had any of the illnesses either), and I certainly won't consider a "new" vaccine, and if it was available for children, i would never do that to them.
0/0	Never happened and never will .. we're like all guinea pigs are all expendable and replaceable‚Ä¶ here's my logic: Bill Gates wants to depopulate Earth / eugenics. Gates pushed vaccines‚Ä¶ Vaccines may denature subjects to be infertile..if not immediately then the generation to follow.. 100%
0/0	Never in 500000000 years will I ever take a vaccine for that
0/0	Never never never
0/0	Never take ha
0/0	Never taking this gene thearpy dna changing 5g controlled. Mrna from aborted babies no way....Itfoesnt make sense to take to begin w. God made human body petfect...And amazing, until we mess w it
1/0	Never thought I'd be so happy to get an injection
0/0	Never took a vaccine since I was little . Build your immune system up what your creator design for u
0/-1	Never trust a white coat.
0/0	Never!
0/0	Never!!!
0/0	Never. God created me and I will not inject poison into his creation...never ever
0/0	NeverI‚Äôll take a vaccine ?? My body my choice. Period!!
0/0	Never¬†¬†this vaccine is evil
0/0/0	New drugs have very very strict procedures in the development and testing before given final approval , this can take years, yet in a natter of nine months the process is complete and licenced for immediate use ! Nobody knows the possible side effect implications. I will take my chance and will not be having the vaccine !
0/0	New mutations in the coronavirus have been reported, which may change the exact nature of the proteins on its surface
0/0	New technology that's barely been tested, and the manufacturer refusing to take responsibility if things go wrong. I'm definitely not taking it.
1/-1	New title. 50% OF THE PEOPLE WE ASKED said they would not get the vaccine.
1/-1	New: Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine ‚Äúhas similar efficacy‚Äù against UK coronavirus variant, a statement from University of Oxford published Friday says.
0/0	Next CNN Headline : ‚ÄúCorona Virus vaccine causes heart attacks‚Äù.
1/1	Next up is twice as many vaccinated as cases. Let's hope to hit that by the end of the month. And that rate of new cases just keeps plummeting, largely thanks to the vaccines, while the rate of vaccine doses given has been increasing in that same time. In the first week of January, there was an average of 260,000 new cases and 500,000 vaccine doses given every day. At the end of January, it was an average of 150,000 new cases and 1,300,000 vaccine doses given every day. It's kind of hard to overstate what a dramatic turn around last month was for the state of the virus in the United States. We went from the absolute worst of it to a precipitous decline that isn't showing any signs of letting up. We're a lot closer to the end than a lot of people are saying. This is very, very exciting.
0/-1	Next video idea: "Inside the lab that made Covid-19!"
1/1	Nice and natural boost to your immune system that!
1/1/1	Nice explanation sir.. it removed my vaccine fear
0/-1	Nice video but I ain't taking it ...
1/1	Nice video! Thanks for informing us in a logic way without prejudice... Vaccination is a serious issue and we should all be responsible and do it!
0/0	Nice. You just changed your DNA mixed with RNA and other stuff we don't know. Atleast some people just... caught it and became immune or got their Blood type tested to see that they were immune to it. Taking that Vaccine without knowing the true side effect is not something to jump at. But to each their own
1/1	Nine months after I was a guinea pig for Oxford's coronavirus vaccine, I'm quite emotional that my parents are getting it on Tuesday. Last May, we knew nothing about it for sure. Now, we know it's safe, it's effective and it reduces transmission. I'm in awe of the scientists
0/0	No Because it is a brand new vaccine, and needs at least 4-10 years to prove it is safe. This one has been rushed out too soon, period end of story.
0/0	No Confidence. Absolutely none
1/1	No Excuses...! NO FEAR...!NO RUMOURS...! YES TO COVID VACCINE...!Just take your vaccine when You will get chance or receive notification by govt. authority
0/0	No I do not want an unlicensed fully tested vaccine where the government has suspended liability so that they not the manufacturers can be sued.
0/0	No I will not be getting the vaccine. We have no idea what the lasting effect will be, I have a family member that had covid 19 and she is sick all the time now, she is in and out of hospital because of it and they tell her they don't know how to help her other then antinflamatorys , antibiotics or pain medications!
0/0	No I will not because 55 People Have Died in US After Receiving COVID-19 Vaccines
0/0	No I won't get vaccinated. I‚Äôll wait for everyone else and their families to be the guinea pigs and figure out what horrible, long-term diseases result from this rushed out band-aid
0/0	No I wouldn't take it I want to live
0/0	No I'm not getting it. Doesn't actually prevent you from getting it, it's only good temporarily, I've worked retail through the entire pandemic, never got it, and I've only had one flu shot in like 10 years. I think I'll be ok.
0/0	No Thank you. I do not consent to being a guinea pig
0/0/0	No To vaccination we know who is behind it...
0/0	No Vaccine is going to come anywhere close to the 99.5% chance of survival and permanent immunity afforded by mother nature. Unsafe and unnecessary vaccines are not a valid choice for any healthy individual.
0/0	No amount of fear mongering, manipulation or intimidation will ever make me take this vaccine. I feel like I fully understand how bad it could damage me but I'm willing to take that risk to subvert from taking any vaccine. Something has been well off right from the start and I feel its all to do with China. I may not have all the facts, and I know I never will, but my gut is telling me not to take it, no matter what. It is no more or no less believable that this virus originating from a wet market in Wuhan than it is being released by the CCP deliberately, starting Bio warfare on a global scale. Most people will natural choose to believe what mainstream media has told them from the knowledge they got from a CCP bought WHO. I can't do that. I also find the fact the Chinese people very very conveniently are the LEAST effected by this virus.
0/0	No because everytime I did a vaccine i got the flu and I'm very young and it's better that people who works in the hospital and who really needs it does it before me.
0/0	No because personally I believe they could try and inject people with something that could kill them or just anything. Plus you could end up getting the COVID just like how you catch the flu from getting a flu shot.
0/0	No because vaccines per a study done by yale in 2017 were found to be associated with mental disorders. They postulate that the same immune cells you create to fight the disease also attack healthy cells.This virus only kills a fraction of a percent of people.
0/0	No body can believa a word this organisation says. These vaccines are only experimental and that makes them extremely unsafe to the point of being poisonous. We cannot sue the pharmaceutical company if something goes wrong so there must be something very wrong with them
0/0	No body can believa a word this organisation says. These vaccines are only experimental and that makes them extremely unsafe to the point of being poisonous. We cannot sue the pharmaceutical company if something goes wrong so there must be something very wrong with them.
0/0	No companies producing vax. Money laundry. All videos are old
0/0	No confidence. No Trust. No vax.
1/1	No consert, no live event without the vaccine people!
0/0	No cure for diabetes but no time we have one for China virus
0/0	No cuz I'm healthy and I'm 16 so the chances of me needing to get hospitalised from covid I extremely small if I got covid. You can never be sure if a new vaccine will have bad long term effects.
0/0	No dam way will i get a shot coming from the WHO cult here , I am a very healthy 74 year old young human that is ,and i plan on staying that way till i pass over..so no thank you here...
0/0	No end to lockdowns ever so you have to ask is there any point.
0/0	No for Covid vaccine now. This vaccine only took months...*months* to develop, not even a year. That's way too quick. Also, how do we know this isn't going to mess up someone's DNA? There's no transparency.
0	No guarantee of immunity! No guarantee of anything yet!
0/0	No harm from taking a poison... Did I understand this correctly?
0/0	No it bloody well should not!! Nobody should b forced to have long-term outcome unknown, so-called vaccine injected into their body against their will in order to go about their business. How soon the lessons of WW2 & Mengele are forgotten. We must be free to choose. Tests only
1/1	No it‚Äôs not. It makes overwhelming sense to get vaccinated. You obviously know nothing about it.
0/0	No liability No chance of it going into me
0/0	No liability for manufacturers... Ruled "unavoidably unsafe" by US Supreme Court.. Covid vaccine does not protect from covid, from covid infection, from spread of covid, from covid transmission... DOES make record profits for manufacturers
0/0	No liabitlity in case of vaccine injury, you have to be crazy to take this shot.
1/1	No logical reason not to.
0/0	No long term data on anything regarding any of the vaccines - period. They have no idea if it will affect unborn children even.
0/0	No long term studies. End of story
0/0	No manufacturer liability, NO trust. If the vaccine makers don't believe in the safety of their product enough to stand by it, why should we?
0/0	No mask or vaccine for me.
0/0	No mask, no vaccines, or no lockdowns for me not doing none of it
1/1	No matter what they say the antivaxiners..Im going to do the vaccine! ..I trust science and medicine more than them!!!!....
0/-1	No matter where you heard that claim about the COVID-19 vaccines, it might be making you wary of getting vaccinated when it‚Äôs your turn.
0/0	No mention of the fact that Moderna and others won't have any liability if the covid vaccine isn't safe and effective? No mention that it is essentially experimental? It takes years to develop vaccines. Now, all of a sudden it's important to make every American a guinea pig for Big Pharma?
1/1	No more masks and foggy glasses, I can't wait
0/0	No need of this vaccine
0/0	No need vaccine only eat healthy foods that is the best vaccines
0/0	No no no something is not right with this covid vaccine omg don't take it.
0/0	No no no. Just wait untill you got your second vaccine and than after few years than make a video..
0/0	No not yet, it's too soon to tell if this vaccine works or if it's even safe.Even if it is proven safe and effective I am not sure I will get one,, I think each person should decide for themselves if they need it or not.
0/0	No one has had the vaccine in their body for more than eight months (as of late December 2020), so the honest answer is we don‚Äôt know yet if these vaccines cause long-term problems
1/0	No one in their right mind would let someone stick them with this rushed vaccine. Scientists tested these vaccines properly for saving human lives. Some filty people are spreading negative comments and influencing other people
0	No one is ‚Äúanti vaccine‚Äù, they are just concerned about a rushed ‚Äúunproven‚Äù vaccine.
0/0	No one should be tracked or forced into vaccines.¬†The governments already starting to control us. There making us wear masks, making us stop working, making us social distance. The governments controlling our lives and it‚Äôs crazy!
0/0	No one wants this non vaccine!
0/0/0/0	No one wants to be a lab rat for the next thalidomide.
0/0	No one will ever convince me enough to take that killler vaccine.
0/0	No one with a brain would take a 'vaccination' developed for a virus (weapon) that appeared a year ago. I'm going to wait and see what happens.
1/1	No photo, but Ken and I were vaccinated Saturday (Pfizer) at the local cottage hospital. Perfect organisation, no side effects apart from a bit of a sore arm late in the day. All gone now. Go get it if you can!
0/0	No preventing this natural part of evolution people . Let it run it course for crying out loud .
1/1	No problems with the vaccine just like getting the flu jab
0/0	No questions, just don`t do it! With survival chances better then 99.8%, it makes way more sense than an unproven vaccine!
0/0	No scientific proof' really means there's no money in the answer so we're not paying for the research
0/0	No serious effects? Tell that to Hank Aaron.... oh wait... he's dead 2 days after taking the vaccine
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	No serious effects? Tell that to Hank Aaron.... oh wait... he's dead 2 days after taking the vaccine.
1/1	No serious safety events relating to the vaccine were observed during Phase 3 trials, with the shot ‚Äúwell tolerated‚Äù across different dosing regimens
0/0	No still don't feel comfortable. üòí
0	No surprise here The vaccine does not make claims to prevent infection nor transmission The long term effects won‚Äôt be seen for years to come We are the guinea pigs
0/0/0	No thank you
0/0	No thank you , I don't want that junk in my body .
0/0	No thank you on the vaccine.
0/0	No thank you!!! I‚Äôm fighting for this situation!!!
0/0	No thank you. I'm not afraid of it. I do believe that it was not properly tested nor in development long enough to know how effective or safe it is.
0/0	No thank you. My kids and my husband and I will most definitely not be getting any flu or covid vaccine. But, I support anyone's decision to do what they feel is best for their families.
0/0/0/0	No thank you. Vaccines are poison. Recent published research demonstrated that unvaccinated people have a higher state of health and less disease than those who are vaccinated!

0/0	No thanks
0/0	No thanks ! Miss me with that poison
0/0	No thanks ... an experimental jab with no evidence that it stops transmission. I do not consent!!
0/0	No thanks I will skip .In my opinion, a new Messenger-RNA based vaccine could easily trigger all kind of autoimmune disorders .
0/0	No thanks I'll stay alive
0/0	No thanks I'm fit and healthy never had flu, exercise good food
0/0	No thanks I‚Äôll take my chances with something that has a less than 1% fatality rate !
0/0	No thanks boss. I'll take my chances with the virus. Vaccine manufacturers aren't even liable for any of the side-effects
0/0	No thanks for me. They rushing things up. They never even tested on animal first.
0/0	No thanks man. Honestly my gut is telling me to avoid this at all costs.
0/0	No thanks politicians and their families first then see how things go in 12 to 24 months
0/0	No thanks will definitely not be getting the vaccine
0/0	No thanks! Experimental therapies by vaccine are not my bag!

0/0	No thanks, you can keep that
0/0	No thanks, you can keep your vaccine, we have an immune system for a reason.
0/0	No thanks,, I‚Äôll stick with the body immune system. But it would be interesting to see you make a video explaining how to effectively disable and shut down this covid19 vaccine once in the body. No ones done that yet, everyone‚Äôs promoting taking the cv19 vaccine, it‚Äôs all one sided. Somethings very wrong about all this.
0/0	No thanks. I dont want to develop Unknown illnesses

0/0	No vaccine for me!!
0/0/0/0	No vaccine for me.
0/1	No vaccine is never 100% safe. The question is, are you willing to be a victim? If you do become a victim, you can not sue the pharmaceutical companies.
0/0	No vaccine is safe. A vaccine in under a year is a joke
1/1	No vaccine no normal life again
1/1	No vaccine, no normal. Yes vaccine, everything normal.
0/0	No vaccine.
0/0	No vaccine. I'm afraid. Instead if everyone around me has had the vaccine they will all be immune, which means I cannot catch the lurgy from them so I won't need to have the vaccine myself

0/0	No way, i will only take it after 2 years. It is a rush job.
0/0	No way, i will only take it after 2 years. It is a rush job....
0/0/0	No way, i will only take it after 2 years. It is a rush job.....
0/0	No way, not even if they try take my job and freedom I still won‚Äôt let them put that crap in me
0/0	No we just don't want the endless side effects a rushed through vaccine could give us.
0	No you don‚Äôt need to know long term ! Just take a look at short term for yourself and you will say no to start with, then no having to consider long term.
0/0	No you shouldn‚Äôt take it. Coronavirus is fake and doesn‚Äôt exist so that means the vaccine is to make people sterile, or it‚Äôs a lethal injection, or it‚Äôs an rfid chip. But it‚Äôs not any kind of cure. People better use their brains
1/1	No you‚Äôre looking at it the wrong way. Why don‚Äôt you try to find evidence that they are harmful to begin with? There is no reputable scientific document that calls into question the importance and safety of vaccines. The only issue lies in that if you have allergic reactions to it or something from issues with your immune system. The one article where all this started has been redacted and the researcher himself redacting his conclusions. I‚Äôm saying this for your safety, get vaccinated
0/0	No!
0/0	No! I am not so sure it works,l saw and see many complications from vaccines.
0/0	No!! I dont really understand, why you need to be vaccinated if you have strong immune system? We dont know yet the side effects in a long run of that vaccines.
0/0	No, I am waiting for Andrew Cuomo‚Äôs special panel of experts to approve this. Remember, he said we couldn‚Äôt trust any vaccine that came out under the Trump administration.
0/0	No, I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs safe, too much rushing to get the product out. No long-term trials. I do not trust it. I do not trust the process.
0/0	No, I personally do not need it and I do not believe in most vaccines
0/0	No, I'd never get the vaccine, and I'm high risk!
0/0	No, I'd never get the vaccine, eventhough I'm a risk taking person.
0/0	No, I'm not going to take it... it's like common flu..my cousin has it and she got over in few weeks.. people died because they already had other health problem.. these vaccine will kill you later..
0/0	No, I‚Äôll wait for everyone else and their families to be the guinea pigs and figure out what horrible, long-term diseases result from this rushed out band-aid.
0	No, I‚Äôm afraid of a vaccine that they complete in less than 6 months
0/0	No, don‚Äôt trust that shit at all
0/0	No, for the simple reason that I'm immune.
0/0	No, for the simple reason that I'm immune. My wife caught it in Spain while we were travelling in our camper van for three months and I did not have very much reaction to the bug at all while she was quite ill for a while and we lived as closely as you can get in a tiny space.
0/0	No, in fact the opposite is true: there is NO vaccine -- mRNA or not -- that has been proven to reduce deaths from C-19. The confidence intervals for all vaccines include 0% decrease.
0/-1	No, it doesn't - not for young people or healthy people. Generally I believe that +90% had it with a high amount of ones who did not even know. From a small 2 days cough to no Symptoms or same as a cold - it has everything.
1/0	No, they take years to develop because of funding, not looking at long term effects. Once the vaccine is gone from your system, very quickly I might add, it can't cause any other effects. So stop lying.
1/1	No, they're not. These vaccines went through the exact same process that any other drug goes through. It went faster because the vaccines had top priority and were able to jump the line ahead of every other drug the FDA was evaluating. In other words, no steps in proving effectiveness or safety were skipped. These same mullets who are saying they don't trust the vaccine are the same ones that demand we "listen to the science". Oh the irony.
0/0	No, vaccines take years to make also it was rushed so
0/0	No,I will not. The current vaccine prospects are being rushed through trials exceedingly quickly, and as such their safety will be far from proven when rolled out.
0/0	No,I‚Äôm planning on getting the disease, if I can find someone actually sick with it.
0/0	No. I care about my health. I have no intention of receiving any vaccine. I remain vaccine free. I remain sickness free.
0/0/0	No. I feel like all three of the Covid vaccinations have been rushed. I want to hear about the side effects to the first people who have taken them. From the volunteers who did a trial with this, I haven‚Äôt heard anything positive
0/0	No. I have done enough research to know that this is NOT about a fake zombie apocalypse virus.
0/1	No. I haven't had the flu in over 20 years. (I had one flu shot). I rarely get a cold. I rarely get sick. I have a very good immune system and healthy constitution. If I get Covid-19 then I get it. But until then, I'll do what I have to do to look after my body and strengthen the immune system as it hasn't let me down yet.
0/-1	No. I think vulnerable groups should have it first and I'm 67 and thin so no risk. Secondly I believe natural infection is more protective and re-exposure boosts immunity.
0/0	No. It takes 10 years to develop a vaccine as it takes 10 years of clinical trials to deem a vaccine safe.
0/0	No. It was rushed to market with less than 6 months of testing, the only vaccine in history to be approved in less than 4 years. It was approved only because of the ‚ÄòCovid emergency‚Äô.
0/0	No. I‚Äôm healthy. It‚Äôs not necessary.The epidemiology data here in Australia shows that COVID19 presents as a mild disease, except in extremely rare cases for the elderly with chronic health conditions.
0/0	No. No. And No. thanks
0/0	No. Not at all. I will not get vaccinated.
0/0	No. Not yet.
0/0	No. Stop im not having it go away
0/0	No. They. Just want to kill us! This is not a joke!
0/0	No. it was rushed to market with less than 6 months of testing, the only vaccine in history to be approved in less than 4 years. It was approved only because of the ‚ÄòCovid emergency‚Äô.
0/0	No.. Because I don't trust. because vaccines take 5 to 10 years to make, not 9 damn months
0/0	No...no....and no........
1/-1	Nobel Prize
0/-1	Nobody knows about the long term effects of this vaccine Same story over and over again.
0/0	Nobody knows how safe is the vaccination just because we have no long term study! This is the very first vaccination in the history without long term study. This vaccination had a 6 months compared to other vaccinations 1-2 years study for long term side effects.
0/0	Nobody knows how safe it is! That‚Äôs the big punchline! Get it? Wake the F up people!
0/0	Nobody knows the long term effects of these mRNA vaccines and that is a concern
0/0/0/0	Nobody knows the long term effects of these mRNA vaccines and that is a concern.
0/0	Nobody should be getting this "vaccine" end of story!
0/0	Non of what the government says. Once a liar always a liar
0/0/0/0	None of my family will take this posion . It is that simple . Exile us from society. If so stop all taxes and do not step foot on my land or the dogs will be released
0/0	None of the manufactures are liable for the vaccines they produce. So if you get any negative side effects its is not their responsibility. So why should I trust them if they have no liability what so ever or reasons to make sure it is safe. Since they have immunity for any negative consequences.
0/0	None of them look so healthy to trust them. I think they spread the virus and than they vaccinate us these mutants.
0/0	None of these are safe.

0/0	Nope!! My Body My Choice............ so NOT going into me!!!
0/0	Nope, I'll wait for a later batch, see if anyone dies first from side affects
0/0	Nope, Moderna has never produced a successful vaccine to now... I'm quite sure all the Trumper's will be first in line
0/0	Nope, Someone else can have mine, It was rushed, Not FDA approved, And liability wavers, No Thankyou.
0/0	Nope, and if it's mandatory I'll find a cave to live in
0/0	Nope, im good...
0/0	Nope. HARD PASS!!!
0/0	Nope. It's not even a vaccine by definition.
0/0	Nope. My children will not have it. There is zero research about how children will react to it.
0/0	Nope. still not getting it. Hell I get a reaction to the flu vaccine since they added swine flu to it years ago. Prior to that no reactions.
1/1	Normal Life will soon return. Just keep doing what‚Äôs important. Please
1/1	Normal Life will soon return. Just keep doing what‚Äôs important. Take your shot!
0/0	Normal vaccines require 8 to 15 years of rigorous testing! So far no mRNA vaccines have passed the animal testing phase....but this 10 month old PfizerBioNTech/Moderna "non trials tested animal" vaccine is safe for humans. What could possibly go wrong. These evil b-tards will do anything for power and money!
1/-1	Normalcy can't come soon enough, but we are almost there.
0/0	Norway Sounds Alarm As 23 Elderly Patients Die After Receiving Pfizer Vaccine
0/0	Norway have had 26 people die from the Vaccine , And now Rumers of UK deaths from the Vaccine are also coming to light .
0/0	Norway patient died after being injected with covid 19 vaccine
0/0	Not FDA approved so how can one say these are safe and effective? If I tried to peddle a product I created as safe and effective for xyz ailment and it wasn't FDA approved I would be in trouble! I guess the most corrupt government agency gets a free pass on lies. What's new.
0/0/0/0	Not a single chance in hell I will take this mandatory or not
0/0	Not a single chance in hell I will take this vaccine
0/0	Not a vaccine at all, it‚Äôs designed to put a nano chip in you . 5 g will activate it
0/0	Not a vaccine... this is mRNA gene editing
1/1	Not anti vaccine or anything and I plan on getting the covid one
0/0	Not confused about this vaccine but I do believe that it will mess up our DNA No thank you
0/0	Not consenting to take part in a medical experiment where the manufacturer has ZERO LIABILITY if you die and does not intend to publish SAFETY DATA for two years does not make you anti-vax - it makes you ANTI-STUPID.
0/0	Not enough testing was done, so we don't know how this will affect anyone
0/0	Not even FDA approved. Y‚Äôall are promoting poison. Already seen one person I know personally get sent to the hospital due to complications from the vaccine. She‚Äôs paralyzed on the right side of her body.
0/-1	Not everyone wants that vaccine.
0	Not for me thank you. I have a God given immune system and I do not consent. But hey, to the presenters of this video, don't let me influence you...enjoy your jab.
0/0	Not for me thanks.
0/0	Not for me. Give the injection to the the government
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Not for me. Start getting ready for the zombie apocalypse.
0/-1	Not get the vaccine until they remove the waiver period
0/0	Not getting covid shot...no one knows what the long term results will be
0/0	Not getting it. It‚Äôs a hoax.
0/0	Not getting the flu or the COVID vaccine! No thank you!!
0/0	Not getting the vaccine, not because of mis information. Because not enough time behind it
0/0	Not going to alter my DNA, No thanks...Going to make a world of stepford wives
0/0/0	Not going to take it
0/0	Not going to take itüöÆ
0/0	Not in my body. Don‚Äôt trust them
0/0	Not interested in any of vaccines ,ill best die naturally then be your gineapig or zombie mode luminati based vaccines ,if we dnt take we cnt use our money wtf youll playing God seriously satanist all of youll
0/0	Not interested, I survived covid19 with home remedies so I don't see any reason to be vaccinated.
0/0	Not me or my family!
0/0	Not me, not here, not now, not ever.
0/0	Not me. That's for damn sure.
1/1	Not my turn yet. I will be vaccinated when it is available for me.
0/0	Not on their life I'm gonna take that damn vaccine! LOL
0/0	Not only allergic reaction. It can damage your nervous system for good. Known as Guillain Barre syndrome. And your doctor will say, it's a rare neurological disorder.
1/1	Not only are anti-vaxxers spreading lies and misinformation, they‚Äôre also spreading the virus and increasing the odds of vaccine -resistant mutations to occur by giving the virus more chances to replicate and thereby more chances to mutate and find a partially vaccinated person or a vaccinated person with a compromised immune system, where it can develop into a vaccine resistant strain.
0/0	Not peer reviewed or through regulatory approval yet - a bit of patience is due!
0/-1	Not really... Let the people take the vaccin who is voluntary want it.. Don't force the people take vaccin then that is fair.
1/1	Not rich enough, or old enough to get a vaccine, anytime soon. Rough estimates for me, and my family are April. So damn frustrating losing everything, while watching some folks that found a way to get go back to normal. That‚Äôs great for the people that are following the guidelines. Not everyone is. Watching younger folks that got it because their family has hospital administrators, bs like that doesn‚Äôt really help my faith in humanity. It‚Äôs still about who you know. The ‚Äúextras‚Äù are told to people, so they‚Äôre in the right place at the right time. I‚Äôve been told my life doesn‚Äôt matter, and I believe it when I see people skipping the line. By the time some of get help, it‚Äôs not going to matter. We‚Äôll be out on the streets. It‚Äôs really hard, after a year of isolation, to not hate everyone.
0	Not safe enough for me to put it into my body
1/1	Not scared of getting sick myself, but scared of infecting others. I want to be able to meet family who are in the riskgroup!
1/-1	Not sure this is the case. My work sent 22k 1a invitations, and about 8k people scheduled a vaccine. There is undoubtedly hesitation on the part of many people, even in healthcare.
0/0	Not sure to take this vaccine. A friend of mine is dead for the vaccine
0/0	Not sure what's in it but I'm not doing it.
0/0	Not taking a Trump Administration vaccine that‚Äôs was rushed NOPE
0/0	Not taking a vaccine made in less then a year
0/0/0/0/0	Not taking a vaccine made in less then a year that bill gates is behind.
0/0	Not taking it and shouldn‚Äôt be forced too they got y‚Äôall where they want ya this isn‚Äôt going near my kid or me been taking care of myself all my life I pay my taxes keep your guns people
0/0	Not taking it at all.
1/1	Not taking it into your body is your absolute right. I HAVE had my first shot. I am 76 yrs OLD. LOL I won't live for ever but don't want Covid either.
0/0	Not taking the Covid vac
0/0	Not to mention that any even considering taking this vaccine should read up on what RNA is and how it basically directs the DNA structure. You may not be concerned with how an untested mRNA vaccine will alter your DNA, being that as an adult, you are likely fully formed, no telling how it may affect you, but a young child? Or have you considered what the most minute alteration to the structure of YOUR DNA may affect any offspring? Myself, I am beyond that concern, still there is no way I will take that or any other vaccine!
0/0	Not too bothered about the 'after jab' effect but I have chosen to decline the vaccine, as have other family members. Good luck to all making their choices.
0	Not unless I am given a list of every single ingredient in the vaccine. And because I ask for the list of ingredients they must comply. The reason for asking is they have a tendency to put in additional ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù ingredients on vaccines that actually cause health problems.
0/0	Not until it is safe for the most vulnerable kids to be there, no. Not until it is safe for the kids with the highest incidence of asthma, blood Pb levels, PFAS exposures, and other environmental injustices that dangerously complicate their COVID risk exposure.
0/0	Not until it passes actual long term testing for potential future unknown side effects. The fasted a vaccine ever got from research to market was 15 years. To push it like this is absolutly reckless and borders on malpractice for political gain. Makes me sick to my stomach thinking about it.
1/0	Not vaccinating your kids only works fine so long as everyone around them IS vaccinated.
1/1	Not you all thinking you know more than thousands of scientists, doctors, and researchers with PhD's who all agree that it's safe
1/-1	Nothing about the Anti-Vaccine certificate protests in denmark i see
0/0/0	Nothing beats a strong immune system. There is no money in it.
0/0	Nothing beats the immune system. Especially young children. Deal with the sickness If and when they become Sick.
0/0	Nothing can prove that the product being injected to these people is the very vaccine. They are being given a different substance but they want to persuade us with the fake posts and later inject us their real vaccine which may be or is mere poison... Beware of such fake promotions...
0/0	Nothing changes in terms of rules whether you are vaccinated or not. Granted are your chances of catching it are dimished as are your risk of being very sick, but at what cost? Still too much is not known about these vaccines. Of course not everyone is at high risk of catching it either.
0/0	Nothing from the government or their appointed scientists
0/0	Nothing is free in the world and by taking the vaccine you essentially become the product!
0/0	Notice how Thomas Reuters & Facebook are fact checking anything that speaks out against this vaccine? No surprise to see both of them are listed as partners on the World Economic Forum website along with Pfizer...
0/0	Notice how he laughs when talking about vaccines, evil creepy satanist. A big NO from me.
0/0	Notice how the government is not telling us to consult with a doctor before taking the vaccine üíâ you have to be a different kind of stupid to take a rushed vaccine.
0/0	Notice how they call it a "jab" now, to make it sound like some routine thing we had as kids to keep the lergie away, as opposed to an experimental gene altering injection.
1/0	Notice the groups of people who are never involved with anti vaxxers. Doctors, virologists, chemists, teachers, scientists
1/1	Now if only the general public can get vaccinated before summer that'd be great.
1/1	Now its up to you, either get rid of the virus or let it mutate into something stronger so that all this is useless and we'd need to go back to basics.
1/0	Now lets eradicate HPV , AIDS ETC :)
0/0	Now lets wait 10 years to see are there any sideeffects and maybe then i will take it!
1/1	Now let‚Äôs hope we have the staff to carry out the huge vaccination programme needed.
1/1	Now prick me already. So ready for this shit to be over.
1/1	Now that we are starting to see positive results from the vaccines, I'm excited to watch the fight over who gets to claim credit for saving the world. One thing history has taught us is that it will definitely NOT be the people who actually did all the work.
0/0	Now the real pandemic is going to start.
0/0	Now they are trying to justify why they went after our DNA using the PCR test. Caught. Stop lying. We're not brain dead. You wish!
1/1	Now this is the good news we have all been waiting for.
0/1	Now we have the most rapidly produced vaccine in history for a virus that is already mutating.
0/1	Now we need a vaccine to stop the spread of stupidity as in antivaxers and antimask types!
1/1	Now, should I be in the US/much of Europe where the virus remains rampant, then I‚Äôll certainly take the first vaccine being offered for the risks out there is far greater than the risks of the short trial and follow up periods of the available Western vaccines.
1/0	Number of confirmed #COVID19 cases:105M Number of COVID19 vaccine doses given: 120M Number of PROVEN DEATHS from COVID-19: 2,292,100 Number of PROVEN DEATHS from any COVID-19 VACCINE: ZERO I hope this puts things in the right perspective. Thank you. #vaccineswork #getyourshot
0/0	Numerous people have already died from this vaccine and the corrupt agencies will never admit it.
1/1	Nurse had to hold my hand...√∞≈∏Àú‚ÄöI had yet to get the second part...did u guys take vaccine?
1/1	Nurses and people in the medical industry are already getting vaccinated by the way. The data shows that everything goes as expected.
1/1	Nursing home I work at has had zero cases among staff or residents since the first round of vaccines. Just got our second round last week as well. Morale is way up and the results have caused some vaccine doubters among the staff to sign up for the next vaccine round in two weeks. Definitely light at the end of the tunnel
0/0	OMG again use Africa for test!!!UNICEF business for wrong vaccine !!!!!
0/0	OOOOPS you didn`t even bother to test it...I say LIARS and DESTROYERS....do your research
1/1	Of course I will take the vaccine. It is significantly safer than many other previous vaccines. The side effects are like the other vaccines as well. So vaccines are the best there is.
1/1	Of course I will. I will not hesitate to get my vaccination. It is time to get contro9l of this pandemic and move on. This country is going to fail if we do not get our economy going again. We already have hundreds of thousands of businesses that have failed and more going under every day.
0/0	Of course NO!
0/0	Of course it won‚Äôt hurt you immediately duh üôÑ. The side effects kicks in later.
1/1/1/1	Of course it's safe! There's a chance you might get an allergic reaction, but it'll be over in mere hours!
0/0	Of course they are hesitant it‚Äôs literally killing people
0/0/0	Of course they lie! This vaccine is not about covid at all! These are vaccines of dehumanization. You will no longer be a divine creature. If you survive, you will become a toy in the hands of the enemy. Controlled and weak-willed.
1/-1	Of course vaccines aren't 100% safe. But here's the kicker: No medicine is!!
1/1	Of course vaccines aren't 100% safe.But here's the kicker: No medicine is!! They all have side effects, some more severe than others. It is always(!) a question whether the pros outweigh the cons.
1/1	Of course, every sane person do vaccinate
1/1	Of course, in 1918 the population of the USA was about 103.21 million, while now it is 330.66 million, roughly three times as high. To lose the same proportion of people as in 1918, we'd have to hit a death total of about 2,025,000. Let's pray the vaccines do their job.
0/1	Of course. If you decide not to please stay home for the foreseeable future. It's irresponsible to possibly put others at deadly risk.
1/1	Of the 30 most vaccinated countries, 20 are in the EU. They are doing fine.
1/1	Off to get myself vaccinated! Let's do this!
1/1	Often a single dose is enough to stimulate long-term protection
0/0	Oh and i hear it can have some awesomely fatal side effects how cool!
0/0	Oh and you can die and it is experimental and you can develop horrible adverse effects. We know this is about money and power and control!
0/0	Oh boy...three injections is really three chances to play Russian Roulette with your immune system. Be wary.
0/0	Oh dear EUronews, this article hasn't even made it to the end of the day before the conclusions it tries to draw are shown invalid. Studies released today have conclusively shown 1 dose provides 76% efficacy for up to 12 weeks and validate the UK strategy of prioritising the first dose. Nice try lads.
0/0	Oh gosh, those vaccines are not ready for human trial
1/1	Oh how the years have changed me. Now when I get excited about shots, it‚Äôs the vaccine kind. Ready to get my second
1/1	Oh man do I miss those polio drops. For some reason I liked the taste so much that I'd keep asking my mother later if I could have some more.
1/1	Oh my. I feel AWFUL after the vaccine. And that is just a GLIMPSE of the full thing. Thank god i got the vaccine.
1/1	Oh now the anti vaccine idiots are at it. These are the people that help perpetuate diseases because they allegedly "know better" than science or medical professionals
1/1	Oh thank gosh. Finally!! I‚Äôm so excited. As soon as my parents can get this vaccine, I‚Äôll finally feel like I can relax a bit
0/0	Oh yea get the whole world trying experimental gene altering vaccines. Sounds like a great idea
0/0	Oh yeah. Going out to get mine for sure! Not
0/0	Oh, hell no I‚Äôm not getting this vaccine
1/1	Oh, so you‚Äôre a scientist now? Or just a doctor? The vaccine effort is international and peer reviewed! Think about that before spreading fear and mistrust on no base‚Ä¶
0/0	Oh, we'll know 10 years down the road when half of these people can't have kids. I sure as hell am avoiding that vaccine at all costs.
1/-1	Ohgawd...hurry! I am not going to survive this.... Hurry before I end up homeless
1/1	Ohhhhhh myyyyyyy cant wait for the vaccine,, MY HERO
1/1	Ohio needs vaccine. Not able to get an appointment.
0/-1	Ok cool, you all get the vaccine so I don't have to :)
0/0	Ok if I`m supposed to trust anything you say, that video did not help you at all. I refuse the vaccination due to this video. It looks dangerous and I`m not wanting to die today. Dr`s already killed me twice with a needle, I`m not going to let you do it a 3rd time
1/1	Ok so I'm now totally sick of all this covid shit.. In And out of lockdown not seeing anyone or doing anything.. fuck it I'll be happy to take a jab.. get life moving again.. and the gyms open!.
0/0/0	Ok so basically they ramping up death shots got it
0	Ok so basically they ramping up death shots got it üëåüèΩ
1/1	Ok vaccine is good to everyone. so go on qnd good luck!
0/0/0/0	Ok what happens if you take the vaccine and then you have an adverse reaction to it or even worse die. Who is liable? Answer: you are!
0/-1	Ok, what is the long term after effects?. Oh you don‚Äôt know because it has not been tested for long enough. 5-10yrs not 5-10 months The regulators who approved this also have a lot to answer to and also must be held accountable if anything was to go wrong.
0/0	Okay I'm not an antivaxxer or conspiracy theorist, but Johnson and Johnson? I learned not to trust their tear free shampoo, and I'm not making the same mistake again
1/1	Okay then. I‚Äôll take AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Moderna. By taking all three I‚Äôll surely won‚Äôt get infected.
1/1	Okay, I'll have an immunity while y'all fucks are dying around me.
0/0	Okay...there‚Äôs a 99.9% recovery rate but your promoting an EXPERIMENTAL vaccine with ‚Äúperhaps‚Äù a 95% success rate that we have NO IDEA of its long term side effects?!?! I‚Äôm sorry, but I‚Äôm going to trust the immune system that God created and not sinful man that creates a concoction of toxic ingredients that is known to change our DNA. Warning: you are worshiping the created rather than the Creator!
1/1	Older members of my family have started getting their Covid vaccines, and it makes me so happy.
0/0	On our own without the vaccine we have a 99% recovery rate...WTF
0/0	On the backs murdered babies for a cold virus with a 99% survival rate.
1/-1	On the day the WHO officially declares this thing as downgraded to endemic, we should mark it as a global holiday.
0/-1	On the one hand our far-right extremists (the sad brexiteers) say the old-fashioned nation state which has caused so many wars in Europe, should be king again. The brexiteers argue that Europen states shouldn't join together to share expertise and co-operate, and shouldn't therefore be building the beneficial new world of the EU. That's what they say over and over again, yet, now, all of a sudden the condemn Germany for coming to its own independent scientific judgement. People would be forgiven for thinkig this smacks of 'euro-hate', pure and simple.
1/1	Once I'm 18 I'm getting caught up on all my vaccines
1/1	Once a vaccine is available at my hospital in canada in several weeks im taking it.
0/0	Once all of humanity is vaccinated for the covit19 and is sickened and dying then the international health community would have accomplished there goal of depopulation so the earth can be saved for them
1/1	Once it becomes available to people like me (not a frontline worker, not in a high-risk demographic, so therefore probably a bit down the queue), yes I will.
0/0	Once someone said "How dare you question it... you antivaxer" was the moment I decided to pass.
0/0	Once the fear and paranoia has left them I would consider taking it, I dont make decisions based on fear, group mentality and economic pressure tactics, I'm not an animal I'm a human being
0/0	Once there is some honesty and transparency in the reporting of side effects and associated deaths. "Switzerland declines to authorise AstraZeneca vaccine"
0/-1	Once you get past covid, you get a free 6 month immunity! Yay!
0/-1	Once you have had Covid, your body has the antibodies. It does not make sense to take a vaccine that is supposed to have your body create the antibodies.
1/1	One case out of millions. I'm totally willing to take those odds to be protected even somewhat from COVID-19. Maybe view the video one more time and try to pay attention. It was a very clear, fair and objective explanation. Just because so far there is no final conclusion is no reason to go flying off into panic.
1/-1	One celebrity speaks out for COVID-19 vaccine.
0	One death from covid is too much but disability or deaths from a vaccine is OK welcome to the double think new abnormal ' slaves
0/0	One death from covid is too much but disability or deaths from a vaccine is OK welcome to the double think new abnormal ' slaves '
1/1	One dose and less side effects. My vote is that we start fast tracking this into the vaccine we give kids. If parents and teachers get the double dose vaccines and kids get this one at least If schools are vectors they won‚Äôt transmit it far and the kids are already unlikely to get severely ill.
0/0	One dose is not enough! Come back for round 2, No Thanks
1/1	One more thing. Take whatever vaccine is available. You're better off with an 80% effective vaccine today then a 95% effective vaccine in 3 months. We don't know what the efficacy of the J&J vaccine will be -but if it gains an EUA but is <95% effective - people should still get it right away and avoid waiting!
0/0/0/0	One must wonder why the makers of the vaccine have been given immunity to any liability for it.
1/1	One of the benefits of being 65 is that I‚Äôm eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine. I got my first dose this week, and I feel great. Thank you to all of the scientists, trial participants, regulators, and frontline healthcare workers who got us to this point.
1/1	One of the great things about these vaccines is that they can be used in a wide variety of individuals
0/0	One of the main reasons I am saying #NoVaccineForMe is that the government has lied to us too many times about Covid numbers, reasons for infections, and the Covid vaccine itself. I cannot in my right mind take what they say seriously. THIS IS MY LIFE!
0/0	One of the medical profession's greatest boasts is that it eradicated smallpox through the use of the smallpox vaccine. I myself believed this claim for many years. But it simply isn't true!
1/1	One of the most massive side effects of the vaccine is - you won‚Äôt catch the virus! Da da!
1/0	One of the reasons the vaccine came out so fast was because the ENTIRE WORLD was working on it. I don't get that argument against it. I still wouldn't take it just yet if I didn't have to, but what is that "it came out too fast" excuse?
1/0	One person dies from a vaccine- It's poison, don't take it! 400000 people die from a virus- Did you hear about the guy who died from the vaccine?? Scary!!
1/1	One shot in the arm and you‚Äôre done and you‚Äôre saving lives, man up
1	One should get vaccinated to protect yourself and others around you.
0/0	One side effect of the vaccine that seems to be cropping up recently is known as ‚ÄúCOVID Arm‚Äù
1/1	One step closer to getting back to reality by corona vaccine!
1/1	One thing I noticed about people who complain about the covid vaccine is that they have questions that can easily be answered but they don't look it up
1/1	One thing I try to keep in mind is for every reported ‚Äòbad‚Äô side effects (beyond fatigue and sore arms) how many people are being vaxxed with no side effects which seem to FAR outnumber those that do.
0/0	One thing to not forget. once the vaccine is in. there is no way out.
1/1	One third of Israel is vaccinated and now the country is seeing covid slowed the fuck down. Data shows that the vaccine works just 31 ppl in 165,000 tracked tested positive after vaccination.
0/0	One vaccine for China-mutant another vaccine for British-mutant, Yet another vaccine for other mutant. What are short term and long term side effects of these vaccines.
1/1	One week ago today I received my first Covid19 vaccination, it was the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and I am happy to report I‚Äôve had no problems or side-effects so far. Now await a call for the 2nd dose.
1/1	One who is close 2 me had phizer been 14 days since his second dose so far so good.Thank God.
0/0	One word: "NEVER"
0/0	One would think they'd cover "what are the side effects?"
0/0	One's personal health should be one personal choice. Period!!!
1/0	Only 27% globally don't agree to be vaccinated?? That's sad and discouraging.
1/-1	Only a fool follows his own thoughts when he doesn't have any serious training in a field.
1/1	Only after vaccinating our adult population we will be mentally free to work without risk of being affected and businesses can prosper,corporate world should think of it as investment rather than a cost
1/1/1/1/1	Only in America would people protest your getting a vaccine that would save your life.
0/0	Only it's not a vaccine. It's a highly experimental biological agent that the only immunity it confers is immunity from prosecution.
0/0	Only reviewed for a few months? Scary.
0/0	Only shot I'm taking has a bullet in the chamber....at least I know where I stand with God!
1/1	Only side effect...a sore arm...to be expected. Pfizer vaccine. A heavy sign of relief...the benefits far outweigh the consequences. I‚Äôll take that. Ready for the second dose.
0/0	Only time and accurate tracking will tell for sure; scientists have to look for unusual patterns of disease in groups of vaccinated people.
0/-1	Only time will tell if the vaccine efficacy is still effective after 1-2 years.
0/-1	Only to 100 centers? That‚Äôs extremely sparse.
0/0	Only way Id get this, is if it were forced on my body unwillingly. They shouldn't of planned this during election year to oust Trump, seeing's how it was a dead give away in timing. Makes one wonder how stupid they are, or they think we are? Funny thing is, I've deliberately tried to catch this thing, but cant. I feel better now, than I have in years.
1/1	Only way to end the pandemic: vaccinations.
1/1/1/1	Oof, I‚Äôm getting my first dose tomorrow and I‚Äôm kind of nervous, but this made me feel a little better
1/-1	Oof. I‚Äôll stick with the Pfizer or Moderna versions.
1/-1	Oops, forgot to add, great video, it is always appreciated how to the point and clear you are in explaining the results!
1/1	Open more vaccine factories !!! Now !!! Make more vaccine. And quit debating whether you can postpone the 2nd dose. Just make more around the clock !!!
0/-1	Operative word synthetic. I pass
1/0	Opinion: If there are any paths at all by which a person can become extremely rich, something as hugely valuable + important as creating a covid vaccine should be one of them. If nobody at all gets extremely rich from this, that indicates a failure on the part of our society
0/0	Or just take Vitimin D3 and Zinc and eat fresh food and go and exercise and hug your friends and let your immune system do its job without a filthy rag around your mouth and nostrils
1/1	Or they attempt to go on an aeroplane and discover the airline, or other country, won't let them enter without vaccination.
1/1	Order aside, I just wish they'd accelerate things. On a per capita basis we're roughly 30th of 50 states. Embarrassing, and unacceptable.
1/0	Ostracizing and mocking people hesitant to take a vaccine that was developed in an insanely short period of time is counterproductive. I think it is reasonable for people to want more evidence than they might usually require for such a vaccine.
0/0	Other than causing some deaths, look what happens to Brant Griner's mother (Pfizer) who's now getting severe convulsion and Shawn Skelton (Moderna) who got adverse neurological orders after vaccinated. Any vaccine that is and about to come out is questionable and rushed, they're all trying to be Superman saving the day and raking money at the same time.
1/1	Our 74 year old father is getting his vaccination in 10 minutes and it's made my week. So thankful.
0/0	Our Bodies our right to choose!!!! We do not want your poison vaccines üíâ

1/1	Our Dad just got his 1st #CovidVaccine today! It was not easy to make happen and thank you to everyone. I am personally so relieved...but we need to do this for everyone! Now!

1/1	Our businesses have been hurt enough, time for vaccination
1/1	Our county is only vaccinating 75 and above, (aside from front line workers, etc) for which we don't qualify for yet. I'll be glad to get mine. I know there's only so much vaccine to go around.
1/1	Our efforts make a difference and the vaccines are working. We must continue to show up to protect one another.
1/1	Our first priority for 2021 is to respond to #COVID19. Vaccines are the first great moral test before us. These must be seen as global public goods ‚Äì people‚Äôs vaccines ‚Äì available and affordable to all.
1/1	Our generation never got Polio, TB, Rubella or Anything thanks to Vaccines. I trust the science and always have. Pity the tinfoil hat brigade.

0/-1	Oxford vaccine is not to be trusted according to international medicine studies.
1/1	Oxford vaccine will free us from this pandemic.
1/1	Oxford's covid vax is just tweeking an existing vax that has already proven to be safe. So you should have no worries on that specific vax.
0/0	Oy vey how would life go on without big pharma? People would be way healthier that‚Äôs for sure
1/1	PD DRDA & other Senior officials of the district also got the vaccine. There is no side effect of the vaccine & I request everyone to take the vaccine when their turn comes"

0/0	Paid advertising of Pfizer vaccines. And is the funny hat also from Pfizer? Well done!
0/-1	Paid well? We will watch you get doses and we will still never take it, just watch you live it while the rest of us know about the earth and aliens
1/1	Pandemic can be contained only through vaccine,if 70% of the people got infected barring the mortality rate,or 70% got immunity through vaccine,why don't you go for vaccine?????
0	Pandemics can overwhelm health systems leading to drug stock outs and overstretched health workers. COVID-19 is disrupting access to testing and treatment and could lead to tens of thousands more lives being lost to malaria, especially in Africa. We can‚Äôt let this happen.
1/1	Paranoid public. Read and get facts before you post antivaxing material
1/1	Parents who don't vaccinate their spawn should face criminal charges.

1/1	Peanuts are a bigger problem! Get the vaccine or wait outside every supermarket and Walmart in the country.
1/1	Peddling anti-vaxx lies should be a crime.
0/0	People SHOULD have a decision in their own health. Because vaccines are PRODUCTS, and products can be faulty, contaminated, falsely advertised, or otherwise useless. Forcing people to take an experimental, rushed, medical intervention is dangerous. Period.
0/0	People actually think the shots work? LOL. Clearly they don't realize Polio was almost gone when the shot came out.
1/0	People after knowing vaccine sides: I fear nothing! But this thing, the vaccine. It scares me!

0/0	People have gotten sick and died already about a day or so after taking this covid vaccine
1/1	People in poor countries line up for Vaccines and they force their governments to get more if they run out of them meanwhile people with all the choice in the world are choosing the wrong option.
1/1	People its a shot its 5 sec i willl really not effect you, you will prob forget abt it in a couple years
1/1	People need to realise that once the most vulnerable are vaccinated, everything will be back to normal.
1/1	People need to understand that this is extremely high. It is very rare that any vaccine gets such a good coverage.
1/1	People need to wake th f up, we NEED to take it
1/-1	People obey authority a lot which is terrifying or good depending on the situation.
1/1	People often forget that there are potential adverse reactions in ALL treatments (medications, vaccines, procedures, ect.). Unfortunately, it's often random. You just have to weight the risk vs benefit.
1	People shouldn't have to die due to others ignorance. Antivaxxers should be exempt from any public welfare. Which in most european countries include school, college, medical, rent subsidizes, etc. They should also be exempt from public places like park, state pools, state kindergartens/pre-school. Hell, make a patch they have to wear so the rest of us can avoid them. Let they have their little anti-vax communities they can mingle in. I want this fucking virus gone so that I can travel or do things like not using hand sanitizer 20 times a day
1/1	People that don't believe in vaccine still goes to the doctor to order more Viagra
0/0	People that gonna take the vaccine ,just know that jezus gonna turn his back on you , dont take it, and the vaccine is just a trick to people only to let you take it ,you cry your eyes out when you know what it is for then it will be too late ,jezus wont listen to you anymore , accept him now and let he lead you to the way he wants you because he had makes us its not people
0/0	People we need to contact our representatives in congress nd ask to make the vaccine makes liable for their vaccines just like other drugs. And to subpoena Dr. William Thompson to tell how he committed fraud showing that vaccines and autism is no connected
1/1	People who decline the offer of a vaccine are a serious issue, and more needs to be done to counter the anti-vaxxer propaganda that leads to these myths and "concerns"
1/-1	People who don't trust the vaccine are, in my opinion, very likely not to trust these things.
1/1	People who don't want the vaccine just leave more for the rest of us. If they want to catch a virus we know nothing about, with unknown long term effects vs. trusting medical science we've come to understand over more than 200 years of inoculating against viruses that's on them.
0/0	People who have autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, or who have received treatments that change their immune response, such as bone marrow transplants, chemotherapy, steroids or drugs that work against HIV, may be worried that they could react to the vaccine, or not get protected by it.
0/1	People who hear these claims may be worried about health effects, being tracked wherever they go, or even faith-related problems.
1/1	People who obsess about covid vaccine distribution not even in the medical field are weird losers in my book. My brother is actually in the medical field as a geneticist and last thing I texted him was ‚ÄúMerry Christmas‚Äù not ‚ÄúHey, are you taking the covid vaccine?‚Äù
1/-1	People with "antibodies". not "antigens". they don't need vaccination if they have recovered. better to vaccinate only those who haven't had a prior episode first....
1/-1	People won‚Äôt even wear masks, let alone get a needle put in their arm. This is good news on the surface, but there‚Äôs a deeper ideological/social issue that needs to get fixed first.
0/0	People! Do not take this vaccine. In addition to the known carcinogens it has cell lines from aborted babies. Concentrate on building your natural immune system.
0/0	People, did you know that vaccines are not approved yet and it is given to people as participants of their clinical trials?
1/1/1/1	People, just get the vaccine, it will save you and everyone else around you, please for the love of god
1/1	People, please get this vaccine and eradicate this horrible disease.
1/0	People: die after taking the vaccine News:They didn't die because of the vaccines
1/1/0	Perhaps I am an optimist as it is too early to tell - but there is something.. unusual happening with the hospitalization data. Cases continue to rise (and positivity rates in most places as well, so it's not just more testing) but hospitalizations have started to inflect.
0/0	Perhaps you guys can take the vaccine yourselves, and do a daily vlog showing your results. Cheers
0/1/0/0	Perhaps you guys can take the vaccine yourselves, and do a daily vlog showing your results. Cheers.
1/1	Perhaps you should ask if DM is a credible news source before using it as a decision maker. Most health care professionals I know, including myself are getting the vaccine.
0/0	Personal choice - I'll not be taking it
0/0	Personally I don't trust the current government, how about it be tested on them before the essential worker's prioritized
0/0	Personally I feel that government overreach is worse than a public health failure which results in a 1.6% case fatality rate virus killing people who unfortunately would easily have died without being infected or did die slightly after being infected. I mean cmon we‚Äôve fucked our economy and our government can‚Äôt be trusted to give us sufficient stimulus for isolation, either let us work or provide the stimulus.
0/1	Personally I would be pretty happy to take a vaccine when one is available, I just recognise that it is some time away.
0/1	Personally i would rather get covid then the vaccine. On the other hand i do want everyone else to get the vaccine so i can take my mask off.
1/1	Personally will be amongst the first citizens to be vaccinated once the vaccine is available in Namibia as an Educator.
0/0	Personally, I don't feel compelled to take vaccines for things I'm not at risk for.
1/1	Personally, I just wish people could read on, get better at interpreting statistics, fact-checking and not be so damn cross-confident in their positions and perceptions so we can all take the vaccine and put an end to this pandemic.
0/0	Personally, I won‚Äôt be having it yet. In my opinion, this one, for obvious reasons, has been rushed through.
0/1	Personally, I won‚Äôt be having it yet.I am not an antivaxxer but, in my opinion, this one, for obvious reasons, has been rushed through.Vaccines normally go through a minimum 5 year trial, to check for long term affects. This one hasn‚Äôt.
0/1/0/0	Pffft, who needs a vaccine when you've got those flintstone vitamin gummies from 10 years ago.
0/0	Pfiezer are not taking responsibility for reactions from this vaccine why would you take something that won‚Äôt take responsibility for the side affects
0/0	Pfizer CEO won't take the vaccine. That should tell you how safe it is!
1/1	Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines are extremely safe, with some mild expected side effects, UK regulator finds
1/1	Pfizer and Moderna have published their clinical trials results. For the Pfizer vaccine, over 40k people were tested and it was found safe. Unless you have an uncommon medical condition or taking an uncommon medication, you are likely safe taking the vaccine.
0/0	Pfizer and Moderna injections are not vaccines. They are injecting people with synthetic gene therapy. The injections will not prevent you from gett
0/0	Pfizer and Moderna only utilized 4% Asians during test trials but it doesn‚Äôt indicate specifically which Asian ethnicity participated in clinical trial as Asian is quite diverse from Filipino, Polynesian, korean, Chinese, Japanese, Laos, Thai, Vietnamese and Cambodian etc...all our physiology and DNA are different and unique so we react differently. They didn‚Äôt test enough
0/0	Pfizer and madorna have immunity to being prosecuted for what they put in that vaccine. So you can't sue them if you're completely crippled after it.
0/0	Pfizer cvaccine is dangerous and more deadly
1/0	Pfizer expects to make $15 billion in sales of its Covid-19 vaccine. That will make it the second highest revenue of any drug, anytime, anywhere
0/0	Pfizer had countless of court cases where they lost. I m not taking their vaccine
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Pfizer has included a no liability clause to their manufacture and distribution. Anything that goes wrong regards side effects..or long term effects which no one knows ..about as it has been rushed through..theres no liability no responsubility.the risk is yours..
0/-1	Pfizer have been fined about $5000000000 (yes 5 billion dollars) for the side effects of previous vaccines, that might have something to do with the public's hesitation tbf.
0/0	Pfizer is testing on children, fuck the shot
1/1/1	Pfizer made it!
1/1	Pfizer or bust for me. 95% efficacy puts me at ease
0/0	Pfizer says if you take the vaccine you can die and if you don't take it you may die
0/-1	Pfizer study ends 2023, Moderna end of 2022.
0/0	Pfizer vaccine potentially is the cause of multiple deaths. Why do they release vaccines without proper testing results?
0/0	Pfizer wants to make instant bucks by intimidating healthy ones of the world having no self confidence .
1/1	Pfizer will make the first covid 19 medicines
0/0	Phahk Fauci, Birx and all the t@ssers at the CDC and in Biden's charade. Oh, and his now new claim (after saying masks are not necessary) that wearing 2 or more masks is safer than wearing one.......YUCK FOU. Just wear the whole box already.
1/1	Pharma companies aren‚Äôt going to spend billions of dollars manufacturing a vaccine that‚Äôs still in testing and may not be approved. They would wait for approvals, in this case they started manufacturing at scale as soon as they were reasonable sure they had a safe and effective vaccine candidate.
0/0	Pharma funds the world lol thank you Robert Kennedy Jr for your work exposing vaccines
1/1	Pharmacy Tech here. I can't wait to hopefully get my vaccine next week and finally stop worrying about getting CoVid every day coming into work.
0/0	Phase 3 clinical trials should go on for YEARS and this doc knows that.

1/1	Phone call at 12ish from my GP practice today, can I be in for 9am tomorrow morning for my Astra Zeneca covid vaccine shot - they're phoning patients ahead of us receiving our letters and working round the clock to vaccinate us. Yep, 4 sure, i'll be there.
0/1	Pity they didnt make such a fuss about all the treatments that have been available months and months back. Perhaps a lot more fellow humans would still be alive.
1/1	PlEASE Give the vaccines faster!...
0/0	Plain and simple The Covid vaccine is designed to genetically modify your cells which is irreversible that gives the government control over your body. LOL. Covid deaths are not on the rise. They don't report vaccine deaths but rather they report them as covid deaths something to think about

0/0	Please all take your zombie vaccin! Vaccin helps for maximum of 2-6 months.
1/1	Please also provide vaccines to under developed countries in time
0/0	Please be careful folks. If the vaccines which have existed for decades are still harming people, what about new 'approved' vaccines which have not seen the light of day!
1/1	Please believe in the scientists people
0/0	Please brother don't take the vaccine, it's the government trying to brainwash you, you're half brainwashed don't be full
0	Please consider not taking the vaccine !!!! Improve health diet exercise nutrition !!
1/1	Please correct me if I'm wrong but, when you have an R of 2.5, you would only need 60% of the people vaccinated/immune to get it down to R=1 right? So we don't need 100% vaccination to get the R below 1. Anyone knows what the R-value of Covid-19 is without any social distancing?
1/1	Please do vaccinate. The current goal is to, thru vaccination, reduce the amt. of folks needing hospitalization and worse, death. The vaccines will at the very least, make everyone's symptoms far milder. Gets us closer to herd immunity also the more we vaccinate.
0/-1	Please don't take a vaccine that has not been proven safe.
0/0	Please dont vaccinate i dont want my kids to have corona
0/0	Please don‚Äôt get the Vaccine it is not safe will change your D&A and may kill you also could be the mark of the beast.
1/1	Please don‚Äôt go down the rabbit hole here. The more evidence that presents itself, the more it seems that reinfection is highly unlikely. With a vaccine widely distributed we will find ourselves in a spot were life will be normal again. This is not going to be an every 3 month occurrence. Again, the data shows that reinfection is incredibly rare. For once in 2020 lets bask i some good news
1/1	Please everyone get vaccinated as soon as it's your turn. It's the least we can do for our loved ones.
1/1	Please everyone. Take the vaccine to flatten the curve everyone its serious

1/1	Please hurry up and vaccinate the clinically extremely vulnerable my husband comes in this group but has got to go work so we‚Äôre very worried
1/1	Please if you dont want the vaccine you will not travel go to theatres concerts etc. We 'stupid' love the vaccine. There will be more for us!
0/0	Please look up ‚ÄúPfizer criminal history‚Äù and see what comes up. Simple. As. That.
0/0	Please people - this is insane. They contradict themselves every day. They don't know what they're doing. DON'T get vaccinated until we have the full picture.
1/1	Please put the vaccineine in the drug store. Ex: me I do not has no body to take me far away from my house for the vacinne but I live close to the drug store. I can walk there. Please
0/-1	Please read vaccine ingredients BEFORE getting the injection(s).
1/1	Please remember the Astra Zeneca Vaccination does give you some protection against other Covid strains besides the South African variant so don‚Äôt be discouraged if like me you have just had it. It can still save your life. Yes we may need a top up, this is true of other strains!
1/-1	Please stop spreading vaccine disinformation.
0/1	Please stop this. You conveniently fail to point out NONE of the MORE than 2,000 patients in this study died or was hospitalized. THIS matters. The purpose of vaccination is to bring the severity down to the level of a benign virus. That‚Äôs how this works. Report it correctly.
1/1	Please vaccinate all teachers sooner rather than later.
1/1	Please vaccine yourself!!
0/0	Plenty of vaccinations don't provide immunity ;only a false sense of safety.....Most people with ACQUIRED immunity are better at not getting the disease again.

1/1	Praying that healthcare workers who have had to endure longer working hours and greater risk during this pandemic will be getting this very soon
1/1	Praying that the vaccine becomes more accessible to all soon.
1/1	Pre existing conditions definitely have an effect on the chances of you dying of COVID and its not just exclusively attributed to that. on the death certificate it is listed as a contributing factor. But saying that its okay to not get the vaccine and walk around a mask because ‚Äúonly a few old people will die‚Äù is selfish
0/0	Prediction: all "vaccine" induced deaths will be added to the Covid death tally.
1/1	Prepped for this when it's my turn - vaccines save lives
1/1	Pretty awesome stuff. Hope to get the utilization rate a little higher, but great progress none the less!
0/0	Pretty sure its not just anti-vaxxers that will be refusing the Coronavirus vaccine..
0/0	Pretty sure the vaccine has killed at least one person. That is one person too many.
1/0	Prevent the¬†COVID-19¬†virus from spreading and replicating, which allows it to mutate and possibly become more resistant to vaccines
1/1	Prevent you from getting¬†COVID-19¬†or from becoming seriously ill or dying due to¬†COVID-19
1/1	Prevent you from spreading the¬†COVID-19¬†virus to others
0/0	Primarily, the fragility of the vaccine itself.
1/-1	Private companies, transport, insurance, etc requiring it will speed up the acceptance.
0/0	Pro my immune system.
1/1	Pro vaccine: evidence as seen by the elimination (or greatly reduced) of polio, tetanus, rubella, etc.
1/1	Pro vax: Reading medical books
0/0	Pro-vaccine propaganda ... that's the impression. I'm not anti-vaccine, per se. But, I remain unconvinced coronavirus vaccine is 1. Safe 2. Effective. Science has struggled, for decades to produce an effective vaccine aimed at coronavirus. The science has not changed. Coronavirus mutates and this version of coronavirus is no different. There are already cases of people re-infected with coronavirus after suffering the illness, during this pandemic. The vaccine experience will be no different. The FDA is fast tracking its' usual safety protocols. I will not be a member of this mass experiment with vaccination. Microchipping aside, Bill Gates, has a commercial interest in the vaccine, and he can't even keep viruses out of microsoft - he has no credible credentials to lecture humanity about the virus, or the vaccinations.
1/1	Pro-vaccine: Intelligence
0/0	Probably not for a while for my own reasons
0/0	Probably not.I am not in a high risk group. Chance of dying if infected would be low.
0/0	Problem in india, even govt assure you for death compensation over vaccine side effects related death, but fake inquiry will prove it, normal death.
0/0	Problem is with proper testing. It usually takes 5-8 years to know all side effects. Make decisions in pressure and fear is not scientific at all.
1/-1	Problem is, conspiracy theorists are overwhelmingly not willing to change their minds, even with evidence.
1/1	Produce more vaccines so one group isn't pitted against another
0/0	Professor meant to say, the vaccines efficacy figures should be taken with a huge pinch salt
1/1	Promising COVID 19 vaccine data coming from Israel. Science is working....... not magic
0/0	Propaganda. don‚Äôt get brainwashed
1/1	Proper social distancing and closing down know arenas for infections are the way to go. Too few people seem to realize this in the US. A collective effort is needed, but is poorly understood by too many. Fingers crossed for vaccinations
0/0	Protection from covid?? How?? If vaccinated, you can still get covid and still transmit covid.
1/1	Proud lifesaver! #Imvaccinated
1/1	Proud of my hometown. Almost every eligible candidate for the #COVID19 vaccine took it. They did it because they know this is how we‚Äôll end this pandemic.
1/1	Proud to be pro vaxx
1/1	Proud to say my only grandma is fully vaccinated now. Ready to celebrate her 89th birthday in two weeks
1/1	Proud to say my only grandma is fully vaccinated now.. Ready to celebrate her 89th birthday in two weeks!!! Thank you everyone making this happen.
1/1	Proud to say that i got #Vaccinated against #Covid19
0/0	Psuedo science "logic": No one dies from the vaccine because we attribute all deaths to Covid.
1/1	Public health is an economic issue. The cost of a vaccine is a miniscule fraction of the cost of shutting down the economy so any government should be willing to spend perhaps a few hundred million in order to save themselves a few hundred thousand-million.
0/0	Public will never trust it nor will we take it. No forced vaccine that attacks your dna. This is criminal. Don‚Äôt take this poison. It is u tested. No placebo testing. Unsafe.
1/-1/-1	Pump it in my muscle, doc! Vaccines don't go into the bloodstream!
0/0	Pushed vaccine's rushed through fast! Sorry no I will not be having one. Has anyone really looked into what is actually in these vaccines?
0/0	Pushing the poison.
0/0	Question though, even with SARS and MERS research how does that help the situation? SARS, MERS, and the common cold are all in the corona virus family with COVID and yet even with all they research they have, scientists have been unable to create a reliable vaccine for SARS, MERS, or colds. How am I supposed to trust that COVID is any different?
0/-1	Question...how the covic 19 create and who create this???
0/0	Questions we are not supposed to ask 1 - Why are people still required to wear masks even after vaccination? 2 - Why are companies requiring that countries who buy the vaccines cannot take legal actions following the purchase? If your products are truly safe why are you making that requirement?
1/0	Quick note for those who don‚Äôt think the virus is that bad. COVID-19 is definitely a dangerous disease though it varies from person to person. The effects of the virus can be different based on a multitude of factors and while it‚Äôs more dangerous among those who are immune compromised, it also affects people based on their genetics. I did unfortunately lose family..... my aunt was very healthy and still lost her life.... vaccines do indeed have fragments of the virus but it tells the body what to fight and how to fight it. My mother and father are both immune compromised. My father with an extensive heart condition and my mother grappling with dermatomyositis (a vicious and rare auto immune disorder.) Some of you out there say that taking a vaccine is a choice and while it is ultimately your choice, it‚Äôs for not only your safety but it‚Äôs for others as well! Now for those of you who are in open defiance of the vaccine and stop people from getting it, (Like the ignoramuses that forced the dodger stadium facility to shut down.) you need to stop! If you‚Äôre so damn adamant about choice in this matter then why aren‚Äôt you letting others make the decision for themselves! Stop doing this! It helps no one at all!

1/1	Right now, challenge isn't that we need better vaccines. We just need more doses -- and we need to get them into people's arms.
0/0	Right, how stupid of me, to be concerned about taking a private, untested drug made by a heavily corrupt, liable free company ''regulated'' by a bribery infected regulatory (CDC/FDA), for an originally mild disease that is now statistically 98% less serious than it was 100 years ago, just through infrastructural-hygiene based development alone, that will make potentially 100s of billions of dollars over the next decade! On top of that, it's not like I can even, just, eat healthy natural food, get exercise, stay fit, and drastically increase my chances of survival, either! Obviously, I should just stick to big macs, coke and fries and watch Netflix all evening, then go to get my vaccine, come back home, take my insulin shot, and pop my oxycontin, because I don't want to be a silly anti vaxxer do I!'

1/-1	Side effects include: may be less likely to die from Covid-19
0/0	Side effects of vaccines can take months or even years to show up, which is probably why it is being tried out on everyone working in the NHS. Showing up after only a day!! This particular vaccine has never been tried on mass human populations. They may hope to hide the side effects on NHS staff but I hope the staff are honest enough to publish serious side effects and especially deaths.
1/1	Side effects so far, sheer joy and gratefulness
1/0	Side effects, you get to live, youre welcome
0/0	Side effects. Will they really show us if there are serious ones? I don't know how true it is but someone was saying that a lady was paralyzed by it. I've been too lazy to look it up to verify it but I honestly don't trust these people to give us 100% truth.
1/1	Sign me up for the vaccine!

Souless creatures need to stop messing with dna or the outcome will be apocalyptic. GMO's, vaccines, wifi, etc have already caused cancer and auto-immune disease rates to sky-rocket. Thank the Lord I'm closer to my way out than my way in to this crazy world. Good luck with all this crazy stuff. Maybe they should just go back and occupy themselves with "reinventing the wheel". It'd be alot safer.
1/1	Simple: if you chose not to get vaccinated, hospitals are allowed to refuse treating you for COVID-19
0/0	Since it‚Äôs not really a vaccine by CDC definition, I think I‚Äôll take a pass
0/0	Since then we now know people do get sever allergic reactions, and many people reported here in the UK that they are still feeling very unwell after 5 days of having the Pfizer vaccine.
1/1	Since we made the vaccine and are testing I think then it‚Äôs gonna end soon
0/0	Since we still do not understand genetic Material you are playing with our lives. Stick to the Parts that Trigger.

0/0	So I just read through alot of comments on this video, and have seen some things said that people took an extreme too. I have never been vaccinated, but I am not anti-vaccine, I am pro-choice. I believe that there needs to be more study on the vaccines that are on the market today. The flu vaccine does not prevent the flu, the covid-19 vaccine is not effective because it does not prevent covid-19. People should choose whether or not they should take a vaccine, it should not be forced upon them. The reason I will never take one is because I know what is in them. And the chemicals are surprisingly deadly, like mercury. I don't care if you guys hate on this comment, I just think that you should try to understand every side of the situation before you cast your opinions. I know people who have been saved by vaccines, and I know people who have lost their children to vaccines. There always two sides and neither side is wrong.
1/1	So I will likely take a vaccine but if I can choose, it will not be the first available and not rDNA based.
0/0	So I'm not anti vaxx, but this is the only vaccine I am not getting. They rushed it. We don't know exactly what will happen
1/1	So Nice
1/1	So a doctor on the new this morning said her second dose in the trial gave her "robust" response. I kind of chuckled at that description. Usually when I get the flu shot, I feel bleh for a few hours, then I'm okay. My temp goes up, but not feverish, I get muscle aches and cold/hot. This time around I was on an immune system "cocktail" for a few weeks. when I got my flu shot I had no reaction except my sinuses seemed to clear up. I wonder if there have been any studies if things like Vitamin B, C, D, zinc, etc might lessen the side effects.
0/-1	So based on this information, given that the vacine is based on the virus and having the whole virus entering the body will have the same effect there would be no point to inject anybody with the vacine that already has had the virus and has antibodies in his/her bloodstream.
1/1	So basically anti vaxxers dont wash their hands since soap only kills 99.9% of germs
1/1	So basically vaccines train your body to become stronger-
0/0	So basically we are the test subjects and if it‚Äôs all good than America and the FDA will approve it.
0/1	So boosters for all... in perpetuity. Government is in total control of Medical care!üëç
0/0	So by the time you are unlucky enough to get globalist vaccine the mutations will be so powerful that vaccine will be rendered useless.And while they are telling you how bad you want the shot,you know it's bs. Where's the flu?where'd it go? Huh?!?
0/0	So can you explain to me , why did me and family get the flu shot last year. And All of us got so sick we almost ended up in the hospital ? I will Never get the flu shot again or COVID shot ! If it works so well then who ever gets it , shouldn‚Äôt worry if me and family don‚Äôt get it . Right ?because you will be safe from getting it.
0/0	So effective, Big Pharma needed to be exempt from any liability. ü§ì Now let that sink in...
1/1	So excited to announce that i got the vaccine
1/1	So far 10 million vaccinations and only 40 allergic responses. So pretty good hope!!!
0/0	So far 2.78% of vaccinated persons developed adverse side effects and just after the first jab. The second jab will have a lot worse effects and the long term effects come later. This vaccination is completely unnecessary and in fact outright dangerous. It should be stopped.
1/1/1/1	So far all my grandparents, my mother in law, my step dad, 2 clinically vulnerable friends and my aunt and uncle have had the jab, which now is far more people than I know who‚Äôve had covid. To me that feels like we‚Äôre slowly winning.
1/1	So far so good! Maybe a bit extra tired but I‚Äôve had a long day so I probably wouldn‚Äôt put it down to the vaccine.
1/1	So far the vaccines seem to provide equally good protection against the UK variant - which emerged in the autumn and has now become the main strain of the virus in circulation.
0/0	So far we have freedom to choose leave me alone never had a flu shot and I won't
1/1	So happy and proud to get my #CovidVaccine!! Thanks to the lovely Thelma, a former midwife, and all the other health professionals - it was super well organised and I am grateful!

1/1	So happy to see people getting vaccines. I will get the vaccine ASAP
1/1/1	So happy we can get more to the folks who need them. Well done.
1/-1	So how long until the average person can get this vaccine?
0/0	So if the vaccine only blocks symptoms, it sounds like it is just creating more asymptomatic spreaders of the virus rather than stopping it. I don't think you can call that a vaccine...a vector maybe..
0/0	So if this can be done in 10 months let get the cure for cancer by next week
0/0	So if we are doing a risk benefit analysis of getting the vax or contracting it naturally and my risk is very low of either dying or having permanent damage.... Then why am I getting this vax again?
1/1	So implausible. I believe you could call me at any time of the day or night offering a vaccine and I'd be there in ten minutes
1/-1	So instead of a simulated attack, our own cells create the effect and the immune system attacks that and remembers it? Interesting
1/1	So it‚Äôs basically theory vs scientifically proved medicine
0/1	So like the ps5. Everyone wants it. Nobody can get it. If you‚Äôre rich then u got it last month.
1/1	So many annecdotes.... so little evidence
1/1	So many emotions today while waiting and receiving my first covid vaccine! I chose faith over fear and hope for a better future
1/1	So many more people will die by not taking it.. Rip to them.
0/0	So many people already died or got serious side effects from this "total, safe" vaccine with no longterm studies aswell i think i rather take the cance of 99,85% of surviving corona :)
0/1	So many people in these comments calling bullshit. So, where's your evidence that they're lying? Where is your evidence that doesn't come from companies that would benefit from lying? Companies that don't make money from the vaccines. How many of those say this is a lie? People accept things blindly, but if anyone here can accurately give me a website or a book or a company that has the criteria above, and is reliable, I will join the 'This is bullshit' side in a heartbeat.
1/1	So many people on here make it seem like vaccines are the worst thing in the world where people are literally making these vaccines to save lives. I'm all for the freedom of speech and ideas, but a bunch of y'all are stupid.
1/-1	So much fear around this vaccine and people firm on how they believe it works
0/0	So much for getting vaccine!! Vaccine is not effective against new variant!! Do you'll just be going it again!!
1/0	So much misinformation & anti-vaxxers out there. People don‚Äôt understand science or medicine. But health workers refusing is absurd as employers can demand it for the safety of patients.
1/1	So much negative feedback in these replies. I'm assuming those replying haven't lost anyone close to them to this virus. Happy to know.
1/1	So much negativity here as per Usual. We all should feel so grateful to the scientists ...
0/0/0/0/0	So my take on this, it's experimental and dangerous
1/1	So national lockdown for January, hold schools for two weeks so we can focus and push hard on a vaccination program
0/-1	So next year they'll say we need another one because like the flu it mutates.
1/1	So overjoyed that my Mum has now been vaccinated!
1/1	So pleased to be getting the vaccine
1/1	So pleased to hear Mum and Dad have their #vaccination tomorrow. #COVID19 has prevented seeing them for so long. Christmas felt especially hard as it did for so many of us. Shortly after Xmas I received this note in the post. It‚Äôs great to finally have hope of meeting again soon.
0/1	So proud of my fellow thinkers and the vaxxed team.
1/1	So proud of my grandpa. Today he got the first round of his
1/1	So proud of my grandpa. Today he got the first round of his #CovidVaccine
1/1	So proud to support the COVID-19 vaccination role out at Elland Road today. So exciting to be part of something so positive
0/0	So really the rest can wait for 2 years when the clinical trials are over...to be safe. Let's wait for the Guinea pigs results
0	So sad you are forcing our troops to take this sham of a vaccination
1/0	So safe, definitely won't harm you. ;)
1/-1	So since your body requires the vaccine to produce the proteins, and this whole process is patented.
0/-1	So taking that vaccine so I can leave this world
1/1	So thankful that I was able to get my first vaccine today! Science at its best!
1/1	So thankful to receive my first Covid-19 vaccine
1/1	So the anti vax people want to die rather than being alive
0/0	So the symptoms are the same as covid and the vaccination does not protect you?! You guys are a joke!
0/0	So the vaccines targets the spike protein in the virus. Yet the Spike protein is what is mutating aggressively in these new Variants. Uh oh
0/0	So they can come up with a vaccine for covid yet still can‚Äôt cure cancer. How about telling us what the long term side effects are u can‚Äôt cause u haven‚Äôt given it enough time. They want to give the elderly it first so they don‚Äôt have to pay them a pension n kill them off
0/0	So they plan killing off more Americans with this shot that has not been through enough time and trials
0/0	So they‚Äôre admitting they have no idea what they‚Äôre giving these people.
0/0	So they‚Äôre still collecting and analysing data. I thought all the relevant studies would have been conducted before mass vaccinating. What other findings may be discovered in future studies? I certainly won‚Äôt be a lab rat....
0/0	So we DOO have an immune system that can heal us without introducing unstable vaccines with little research and no long term cause information.
1/0	So we apparently know nothing about this virus yet weve managed to develeop a "vaccine" in 9 months
0/1	So we are guinea pigs? "take this stuff. It won't get you sick but you may get people sick". WT???" If the vaccine neutralized the virus in a person, how can it spread? By political magic?
1/1	So we don't trust the government and we don't trust big multinational companies. I get that. But when did we stop trusting doctors
0/0	So we get the vaccine but we can still get C-19, so we have to keep wearing masks and distancing! And we might have fever and muscle aches for 24-48 hours. Wow! Where can I sign up!!??
0/0	So we get the vaccine but we can still get C-19, so we still have to keep wearing masks and distancing! And we might have fever and muscle aches for 24-48 hours. Wow! Why the vaccine then!!??
1/1	So we need to get the vaccine out double quick with all haste . Use everyone inc volunteers to round everyone up and get it done 24 hours a day . That way we reach herd immunity and total protection in double quick time and then we can all start our new and rewarding lives sooner .....
1/0	So weird the only side effect from the second covid vaccine I‚Äôve had was hearing a strange voice in the night say ‚Äúmicrochipping complete‚Äù
1/1	So what everyone really needs to think about is do they want to risk getting the ACTUAL disease (which definitely has possible long-term side effects and even death), or getting the vaccine (which has shown very few if any minor side effects, and no major ones, and definitely NO death)? So like, risk lung damage/brain damage/death, or risk something that has harmed no one?
1/0	So when do the rest of us get to be vaccinated? Been waiting long enough. We have an economy to rebuild and they're vaccinating pensioners.
0/0	So when the vaccines start doing damage to the population we should jail the politicians and reporters who endorse it.
0	So when you both take the vaccine come back and give us your input! For the moment, no thank you..!
0/0	So when you both take the vaccine √∞≈∏‚Äô‚Ä∞ come back and give us your input! For the moment, no thank you..!
0/0	So where does the microchip go
0/0	So where in the submission from Moderna to the FDA do we find a statement that you would use as proof that the vaccine offers verifiable protection against symptoms, infection or transmission from sars-cov-2? Please quote the submission and link to it.
0/-1	So why do you need the vaccine if you have already had the virus and recovered?
0/0	So why doesn't the medical studies show that it prevents infection? And why change the definition of vaccine?
0/0	So why has this still not been approved by the FDA then, yet the world is insisting on jabbing everyone with this?!?!
1/1	So why have we , the over 70 no say the we will take the Astro Zeneca vaccine. I am over 70 and sick of being put in a box. I want any vaccine ASAP. üò°
0/0	So why is the news reporting that people are testing positive for Covid-19 after getting the vaccine?
0/0	So why take it if I can still get the virus makes no sense
0/0/0	So why take the vaccine if it's not helping the virus why should I put that poison in me? I am not taking it it's all about controling humans and money
0/0	So why ya'lls still wearing your masks even after receiving the vaccine though
0/0	So yalk are happy with a vaccine that attaches to your DNA and changes it?
0	So yall want me to get the shot and the gov. Gives it free? And gov. Has their dirty little hands in health care huuuummmm that's like budwiser getting in the car insurance game. NO THANKS!!!!!!
1/-1	So you can‚Äôt get it right away?
0/0	So you get this experimental vaccine, you can still get Covid, still pass it to others, and still have to wear a mask and social distance. This also doesn‚Äôt highlight the countless individuals who were injured by this vaccine in the short amount of time since it‚Äôs rushed emergency approval.
0/0	So you have a chance to die twice :D who wouldn't want that. Update: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Just answered that dudes question lets see if youtube will post it :o
0/-1	So you're going 2 get the vaccine right. I want you to take live on YouTube
0/0	So your body constantly makes the spike.. Your immune system then attacks the spike... Isn't that going to lead to massive autoimmune diseases ???
0/0	So you‚Äôre gonna take something that‚Äôs 73% effective against a virus that has a 2% fatality rate ?????????? Uhhhhh
1/1	So, Dad‚Äôs now had his first dose of the vaccine!!....Mum‚Äôs turn tomorrow!!
0/0	So, according to this video (at 6:17) the DNA does get changed.
1/1	So, anyone who knows me knows I am very pro vaccinations. I have decided to lead by example and get vaccinated on Monday for Coronavirus so that I can better take care of my patients and serve my community!
0/0	So, no liability for Pfizer. That is telling you how this vaccine is safe.
0/0	So, we are being used as Guinea pigs.
0/0	So.... the "truth" is, we still have a lot of unanswered questions
0/0	So...Getting the #COVID-19 vaccine... -Doesn't mean you can remove your mask -Doesn't mean you can stop social distancing -Doesn't mean we can end the lockdown -Doesn't make you immune to COVID-19 -Doesn't prevent you from getting COVID-19... So why get it?
0/0	So...the vaccine is safe BUT doesnt protect you from getting covid. How useless!
1/1	Social distancing measures, not the COVID-19 virus itself, have had the biggest negative impact on the economy. We need a vaccine
1/-1	Social distancing will be around until at least mid-2022. Manufacturing & distributing a vaccine to the entire species won‚Äôt happen in the next few months. We‚Äôll have to improve communications tech massively to keep everyone socially, emotionally, & psychologically fulfilled.
0/0	Solution? Forget trying to influence your legislators. Boycott all pediatricians! Simple and effective.
1/1	Some anti vaxer said ‚Äúlet me guess your still in school‚Äù I said ‚Äúyeah because I am vaccinated‚Äù I can‚Äôt wait for their reply
1/1	Some good news, my 95-year-old Grandma got her vaccine today. She said it didn't hurt, but then again Grandma is way tougher than me
1/1	Some measures need to be forced.
0/0	Some more propaganda for your feed.
0/0	Some of us are immune to your lies
0/0	Some of us would like to keep our minds, body‚Äôs and souls thank you
0/0	Some of us would like to keep our minds, body‚Äôs and souls thank you üíú
1/1	Some of you feel the need to proclaim to the world that you don't want the vaccine. We really don't care. It's better for the world if you don't take it. Survival of the fittest. Bye Felicia.
0/0/0/0	Some people are dying from the vaccine no one reporting
0/0	Some people are still getting COVID-19 after being vaccinated. Don‚Äôt trust this vaccine at all
0/0	Some people have died from this vaccine. A lady fainted and died from it
0/0	Some people have seen claims that large numbers of people are getting seriously ill from the vaccine, that the risks of the vaccine aren‚Äôt being reported, or that officials know there are long-term risks but are keeping them secret.
1/1	Some people, including me, believe the vaccine may give them an opportunity to live without Covid-19. So... anti-vaxers, mind your own business and leave people to make their own decisions. A bunch of nit wits
0/0	Some recipients have died from the vaccine..and some with certain health issues are discouraged from getting the vaccine
0/0	Some recipients have died from the vaccine..and some with certain health issues are discouraged from getting the vaccine.
0/0	Some recipients have died from the vaccine..and some with certain health issues are discouraged from getting the vaccine. But I guess something is better than nothing...but I think I'll wait a little bit longer.
1/0	Some recipients have died from the vaccine..and some with certain health issues are discouraged from getting the vaccine. But I guess something is better than nothing...but I think I'll wait a little bit longer. üòé
0/0	Some vaccines do help, but a vaccine developed and researched in only a matter of weeks. Surprised you keep promoting the covid vaccine. If you want to be a guinea pig that is your choice, but quit encouraging others to do so.
0/0	Some?? Try 10s of thousands. This is month old news. Not even frontline workers want to be poisoned. Says a lot.
1/1	Somehow antivaxers believe in coincidences, how do they explain that polio is virtually nonexistent in countries with the highest rate of polio vaccine? It‚Äôs just that they won‚Äôt admit it.
0/0	Someone can have mine.......
0/0	Someone else can have mine I really don‚Äôt mind.
0/0/0	Someone else can have mine.
0/0	Someone just died after receiving the vaccine in placer county
0/0	Someone who doesn't want to be injected with an untested drug is not an antivaccine activist. He or she is just a sensible person.
0/0/0	Something big is going to happen soon.. I am not taking that shit ok.
0/-1	Something is NOT RIGHT about this vaccination crap
0/0	Something is not right. They have not seen the data of the side effects but they are advertising the vaccine already.
0/-1	Something tells me this "survey" was asked to about 6 people.
0/0	Something that is safe shouldn‚Äôt be mandatory.
1/-1	Sometimes I'm feeling that freedom is a double edge sword.
0/0	Sometimes sooner... so far 23 people died as a consequence of being vaccinated in Norway alone.
1/1	Sometimes vaccines won't protect you, same with eating veggies and excersising everyday won't ensure you live a long, happy life. But it does help.
0/0	Soo......it is a test vaccin....:))) Go to Hell with this vaccin.....
0/0	Soon Zombie Nation to arrive!
1/1	Sooo happy for you.. glad you went with vaccination
1/1	Sorry but at the end of the day these people have 2 choices, have the vaccine and feel slightly unwell for a couple of days, or reject it and risk severe illness or even death. I know what my choice is when my turn comes!!
0/0	Sorry christy, but NO THANKS. You keep it and you take it
0/0/0	Sorry no vaccines here for me and my family not happening were passing on it won't be no side affects here were not taking it üëç
0/0	Sorry that I'm not afraid of something that has a 99% survival rate.
0/0	Sorry this vaccine about a virus that‚Äôs still not known enough is complete crap!! The flu vaccine is only 67% after how many years?? With a 98.9% recovery rate I‚Äôll take my chances.
0/0	Sorry to be blunt. All news channels are are full of sensationalist bollocks.
0/0	Sorry you had to take a vaccine for a disease that doesn‚Äôt exists. It is a bunch of generic symptoms that can be attributed to any disease that have been given a new name.
0/0	Sorry! I too am in the medical field but will NOT be running out to get this pushed through vaccine. I will wait to see how this all plays out. Too many uncertainties.
0/0	Sorry, but NO THANKS. You keep it and you take it
1/1	Sorry, i wish i could but we‚Äôre in Pakistan, where the term ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù regarding COVID doesn‚Äôt exist because our govt is waiting for ‚ÄúFREE STUFF‚Äù from you and any other country. So if you have any leftovers, please do give it us!
1/1	Sort of, but even if vaccines don't stop infections, they will cut down the amount of time they are replicating. Fewer replications before being cleared greatly reduces the speed of mutations arising.
1/1/1	Sounds like a great vaccine I am excited about it. Since my children have asthma problems.
0/0	Sounds like one is playing the Russian rulet when choosing to take the vaccine
0/0	Sounds more like indoctrination centers!!
0/0/0/0/0	Sounds to me like the beginning of planet of the apes
0/1	Sounds too good to be true this vaccine is a placebo üòÇ
1/0	Sounds wonderful, the caution comes when we have no data to tell us of the long term effects of the vaccine, I am talking years decades. now if you are elderly it's not a big issue, (how long do you have anyway), but for a young person?? seems risky.
1/1	Spending in the UK has fallen. Vaccines should help the UK economy recover rapidly later this year.
0/-1	Sponsored by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
1/1/-1	Spring lasts until June 19 so I would certainly hope so

1/1	Stay protected and vaccinate yourself!
1/1	Stay safe, be good, care for each other, and talk with your family, friends, and others about getting vaccinated.
1/1	Staying at home while the vaccine is rolled out has made all the difference. The number of new COVID-19 infections in Barking and Dagenham has decreased dramatically in recent weeks. New daily infections are at a two-month low. Together we are keeping our community & NHS safe.

0/0	Stop forcing things on people they don‚Äòt want. Nuff said.
1/1	Stop making people believe vaccines cause autism
1/1	Stop spreading disinformation. It was not rushed. There is lots of Covid out there so it didn‚Äôt take long to prove. You deserve to be put down for calling vaccines dangerous. You are dangerous. Vaccines have millions of lives every year
0/-1	Stop talking about this virus, the virus doesn't existe. It is just an cibervirus, the cibervirus of Bill Gates , Elon Musk, and others part of New Age MHO . They want to kill 50% of people √Æn the world.

0/0	Study? They haven't even studied the original one. The people getting these experimental injections are the study. No liability
0/0	Studying your report, it looks like my safest option is to opt out. I appreciate your transparency. I just hope others read it.

1/1	Super informative. Makes me feel better getting the vaccine tomorrow.
1/1	Sure didn't want to miss seeing the Inauguration yesterday, but my personal celebration was keeping my appointment to get the Covid vaccine instead. Then today my 96-year old aunt called from her assisted living residence, finally feeling like talking as she's fighting Covid, but she's beginning to improve. They have been on lockdown since the beginning and have only recently had Covid cases. Her best friend at the facility was buried today and she was feeling low. We cheered each other up, counting blessings. Times are hard for everyone, but if you still love this precious gift of life: Get the shot when offered.

0/0	Sure! The COVID-19 vaccine is totally safe, until it is administered!

0/0	Surrender 100% of your humanity for something with around a less than 1% chance to affect you. Their numbers. All from a "deadly virus" you need to have an unreliable high false positive test not specifically designed to detect this 99% survival "virus"

0/0	THIS IS WHY IM CHRISTIAN BECAUSE SATAN WANTS TO INJECT MY KIDS WITH AUSTIM
0/0	THIS is not a 'vaccine' in the common sense of the word ... this changes your DNA ....offering control to the elites over your health ! Your immune system will not work as it should ... very definitely NOT about a virus" As for passports to travel ... there has never been a vaccine above 50% PROVEN efficacy ... never mind safety ! The present flu shot on gov.uk is given as an ESTIMATED 45% efficacy ... we have data that indicates MUCH lower ...so what's the point of that! The Russians have begun covid 'vaccinating' ... but only to hospital staff who have HAD covid ( it was on RT) .... the very people who already HAVE built in immunity and so they can say its a 90% efficacy!!! Covid ...Certificate of Vaccine ID! So many lies !!!
1/0	THIS is the vaccine I want (just so I can store it in my fridge) looooool
1/1	TO BE Vaccinated
1/1/1/1	TO EVERYONE WORRIED ABOUT TAKING THE VACCINE I was as well until I found out that Covid has been around for YEARS it just morphed into a version that was more deadly. Because of this scientists were able to use data already available from studying this virus to create an effective vaccine. I hope this helped!

0/0	TRUST NO ONE!! AINT NO VACCINE TO MAKE ME FEEL GOOD!!
1/0	Take a vaccine for a virus with a 99% survivability rate? No thanks. I'll take my chances. I've had the common cold (covid) many times. I lived. This is about control. Nothing more
0/0	Take an unproven vaccine whose manufacturers won't even take responsibility for bad outcomes, to avoid the sniffles? Nope.
0/0	Take care of my own immune system, stick that vaccine Where the sun does not shine,
0/1	Take control of your own lives and what you put in your bodies. Is not rocket science. That‚Äôs the only real preventive medicine.
0/0	Take fresh herbs they are all antiviral and stop worrying..The reason they wish so many vaccinated is to eliminate the control group. Yes, I do believe we can improve our immune systems functions of working to protect us. I just disagree with the methods used and imposed upon us. Vaccinations are toxic by their ingredients and cause an inflammatory response and in some cases can knock the immune system well off kilter. Building health with fresh herbs that are antimicrobial and antiviral, antibacterial etc, has no such issues. Mother nature has all the kindness, mans science has all the cut burn and poison. Which many of us now are trying to recover from.
1/1	Take it asap

0/0	Takes MRNA (Murder Right Now Anthony) to a whole new level. Also goes to show how pussified and stupid people are. They have been driven into a state of morbid fear (of absolutely nothing) to the point where they will stand in line, in the middle of the night, to get injected with a human pesticide containing an IGR, just so this poison doesn't go bad. Pure Darwin at work here. These pussified sheep will make the ultimate contribution to the gene pool. They'll remove themselves from it.

1/1	Tell me the time and date of my vacation and I‚Äôm there!
0/0	Tell me then...why are autoimmune diseases on the rise? Our bodies are attacking themselves because there is so much pollution in the atmosphere, and it's all going into our systems. The amount of vaccines we're giving our kids, and ourselves is over the top. Sometimes you need to pick and choose your poison I guess.
0/0	Tell them how people have died from this so-called vaxx or become very ill .¬†Why don't you tell the truth ?
0/0	Tell us about the side effects 2-5 years from now
0/-1	Tell your parents you are not vaccinating your child‚Ä¶
0/0	Ten years from now they‚Äôll be saying ‚ÄúIf you took the COVID vaccine you may be entitled to compensation‚Äù times are different now. They put strange stuff in our food and our vaccines that they didn‚Äôt when my grown children were young.
1/1	Tens of thousands of brave, healthy people around the world agreed to participate in these clinical trials. Over 90% effectiveness compared to people who didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs frankly great. It will honor their participation to follow‚Äîand keep us from getting sick
1/1	Tens of thousands of people have received the vaccine for testing, no one has died.
1/0	Tens of thousands of people who have convictions for drug offences, fraud, dishonesty, assault, football hooliganism etc etc will soon find their future horizons are very limited, incl being barred from foreign holiday destinations, once Covid controls have been lifted.
0/0	Test it on public officials first. Preferably those close to the top. If it works, then we are good. But if not, then they gotta try making it again.
0/0	Thalidomide was said to be safe My mother was offered it but refused.
1/1/1	Than what explanation is for those children who received vaccines and are fine? That some vaccines are tainted? And the lucky children had an untainted vaccine?
1/1	Thank God! when I get my jab, I will probably cry in relief and thankfulness.
0/0	Thank God, most of the people on this video are intelligent enough to not take an untested vaccine and by testing, the average vaccine takes 15-20 years, this vaccine is being pushed out in less than a year. No thank you!
1/1	Thank Science! It's finally happening. Happy, happy day. Long way to go but it's a start.
1	Thank You for your very difficult job ...even when silly people still have the nerve to criticize
0/1/1/1	Thank You moderna got my first vaccine get my booster late this month.

1/1	Thank goodness Trump pushed so hard for them to get a vaccine
1/1	Thank goodness for all the effective vaccines we can get.
1/1	Thank goodness for intelligent doctors and of course science
1/1	Thank goodness for that! Bring on process. Speed it up. It‚Äôs the only way to get things back on track!!
1/-1	Thank goodness sense and a want to be safe has mostly overridden the gear and scaremongering
1/1	Thank u President Trump !!!! Speeding up vaccine saved lives!!
1	Thank you Doctors. Hope it is successful and safe for humans and not become zombies as side effects.
1/1	Thank you Dr Hanson. That was very informative and helpful information. Will you keep us updated on progress with the Johnson and Johnson vaccine?
1/1	Thank you God for making vaccine possible! We are jumping for joy!!
1/1/1/1	Thank you I will take it
1/1	Thank you Pfizer!!!
1/1	Thank you President Biden. I am hoping that there will be a focus on vaccinating teachers, school support staff, students and parents prior to mandating that schools reopen within 100 days.
1/1	Thank you President Trump for Operation Warp Speed which helped get these vaccines developed.
1/1	Thank you all for doing a great job well done may God bless you always,it's great feeling the va√ßcines are Here hope for humanities world wide,
1/1	Thank you all for sharing. I can‚Äôt Wait to get my vaccine! No sarcasm. I‚Äôm so ready for some form of normal and not being a prisoner in my own home! How can I move up the line?

1/-1	Thank you doctor.. Very important ... And thank you for sharing own experience.. for remove miths from we general public..
0/0	Thank you folks, for making known and exposing the sane minded MINORITY that's not completely comfortable with FORCED vaccine
1/1	Thank you for all you do. I love your family. I will get the vaccine as soon as I can as well
1/-1	Thank you for being such a sound minded middle ground person. We need more of them. People try and make vaccines so black and white when it‚Äôs not.
1/1	Thank you for educating us! Please everyone get vaccinated as soon as it's your turn. It's the least we can do for our loved ones.
1/1	Thank you for explaining the MRNA vaccine!! It was so much more understandable when you broke it down. I‚Äôm getting the vaccine on Tuesday the 22nd since I‚Äôm considered a frontline worker. Many people I‚Äôve talked to in my community are worried to get it but with all the scientific information I‚Äôve read it is safe. I‚Äôm not scared at all. And I hope more people do their own research.
1/1	Thank you for explaining what is meant my ‚Äúrushing‚Äù the vaccine. I wish all news channels would take the time to explain this and help dispel ignorance and fear.
1/1	Thank you for finding the vaccine for Covid 19 so we all can have hope for the new year, Pfizer.
1/1	Thank you for getting it! I can't wait!
0/0	Thank you for giving this review. I am not inclined to get the vaccine at this time. I have no complicating conditions.
1/1	Thank you for helping people for the vaccine we hope everyone get the vaccine God bless
1/1	Thank you for helping to fight the virus and trying to calm fears about the vaccine. I would roll my sleeve up for the vaccine today if it were available.
1/1	Thank you for helping to save lives. We appreciate all the hard work done by Pfizer team members. Great, brilliant work. Vaccines work. Vaccines are safe. Thank you Pfizer!!!
1/1	Thank you for making this video I see so much misinformation going around about this vaccine
1/1	Thank you for posting this picture and for being an advocate of the COVID-19 vaccine.
1/-1	Thank you for sharing this information. It is great to hear that you are working with scientists and medical experts across the world to protect us from Covid, thank you
1/-1	Thank you for sharing! I am very much interested to hear more of your experience with the vaccine
1/1	Thank you for sharing. Getting my second dose next week.
1/1	Thank you for the beginning of the end of COVID! Got my first shot 2 days ago, no problems.
0/0	Thank you for the detailed scientific explanation. Can we be assured this vaccination is perfectly safe? Can we really trust Pfizer/Big Pharma? Do you have complete trust in Pfizer and in the clinical trials? Personally, I have no trust in them. They are immune from liability lawsuits. I guess when you have that much money and power, you are untouchable.
1/-1	Thank you for the great info. My question is if the spike protein (created by our cell's ribosomes) are expressed on our own cells, wouldn't our immune system then attack our cells?
1/1	Thank you for the neat breakdown. Hopefully, people will actually learn something for once from this and take the vaccine
1/1	Thank you for the neat breakdown. Hopefully, people will actually learn something for once from this.
1/1	Thank you for the vaccine against the covid 19. Thank you very much. Really the people need to be vaccinated. Mandatory vaccines in the United States airports. That's only way to vaccinate a lot of people. The vaccines are important to avoid diseases. Thank you. The airports need vaccines or everybody!!
1/1	Thank you for the vaccine!!!
1/1	Thank you for the vaccine!!!!
0/-1	Thank you for the video, however instead of COVID VAccine you should say/write Pfizer Vaccine because there is a big difference between Pfizer Vaccine and Oxford etc...
1/-1	Thank you for this :)
1/-1	Thank you for this concise and informative discussion. I appreciate that you were able to simplify such a complex topic without glossing over its scientific basis. That is not always easy to do, but I have seen it consistently done in your many COVID presentations. I think MedCram provides the best science-based information on the internet for public consumption and have recommended you to nearly everyone I know.
1/1	Thank you for this information. It‚Äôs very informing. I am currently enrolled in the AstraZeneca vaccine trial. I have not yet received a vaccine or placebo.
1/1/1/1	Thank you for this! Going to share! Dr Seema perfectly articulates what I explained to my family and friends who naturally have reservations about the vaccine.
1/1	Thank you for this! I'm a young person, but I work with the public. I live in a rural area and my local health dept. has a standby list for vaccines that my boss signed me up for when she learned about it (she knew I'd want to be on it). I get the first of the Moderna vaccines tomorrow. I've never been excited to get a shot before, but I certainly am now!
1/1/1	Thank you for vaccinating my 95 year old father who is in an assisted care facility. He got his 2nd shot one week ago and had zero side effects. So grateful and so hopeful.
1/-1	Thank you for your brilliance and making an additional deal with the United States for more vaccine
1/1	Thank you for your enormous work, so difficult in this moment. Vaccination is an act of civilization. We have to take care of each other.
1/1	Thank you for your enormous work, so difficult in this moment. Vaccination is an act of civilization. We have to take care of each other. #iamhere
0/0	Thank you for your service, I'm not planning to get the vaccine, I rather aquire immunity through infection. I think eventually we all will be getting it at some point.
1/1	Thank you for your work!!! Here‚Äôs to science!!
1/1	Thank you so much Dr. med. Seheult for your education. üåº A user in the comment section reported that these mRNA-DNA vaccinations would work just like the dengue fever vaccination. Ask for clarification, thank you. üôè
1/1	Thank you so much for actively taking part in stopping the spread of COVID-19
1/-1	Thank you so much for sharing this information, your knowledge with us
1/1	Thank you so much for this - beautifully clear! Do you know whether there have been any studies testing whether mixing vaccines is as effective and safe as dosing with a single vaccine?
1/-1	Thank you so much for this video I'll be sleeping better tonight
1/1	Thank you so much for this video! Without it, the vaccine was just a 'thing' with the face of a company being discussed politically. This made me feel more connected to the scientists behind its research. I really appreciate it.
1/1	Thank you so much for your excellent update. Stay safe!
0/0	Thank you so much to both of you for the info but I am not mentally ready to get the vaccine yet.
1/1	Thank you so much, you just got me the best info about who can get the vaccine, I have hopes for my family
1/1	Thank you so much. My family is scared of getting the vaccine so I showed them this video and it really helped. "You fear what you dont know"
1/1	Thank you that you finally said something about side effects, more people are assured and want to take a vaccine
1/1	Thank you to President Trump for getting this vaccine before the end of last year and your governor for allowing you to receive it. Cannot wait to get mine.
1/1	Thank you to all the scientists and researchers around the world for making the vaccine available this early.
1/1	Thank you to all the scientists that have worked unceasingly to make this happen, even in the face of all the naysayers, You've come through with a vaccine. Well done.
1/1	Thank you to our amazing scientists and those who took part in the trials.....wonderful news
1/1	Thank you to the WHO for sharing this very informative video. I do hope many more will trust science and progress, and understand that vaccines are safe and they are the only way out of this pandemic.
1/1	Thank you to the people who worked so hard, to get us a vaccine, I've had one injection just waiting for the second. Feel safer.
1/1	Thank you very much for this clear information and for your most valuable work. Vaccines are the only way to get rid of this pandemic
1/1	Thank you! I hope y'all continue to stay as safe over there in California as possible, and that you are able get your vaccines when you're able to!
0/0	Thank you!Give my portion to someone else!I don't trust ur advertising HSE!Once you take full responsability of the negative effects of the vaccine,i am in,if not,keep it for yourself!
1/-1	Thank you, I was looking for this very thing- explained clearly, much appreciated.
1/1	Thank you, for that verified information we have no choice but to believe and take it.
1/1	Thank you, had my vaccination yesterday. I am one of many that appreciates what you are doing.
1/1	Thank you, hopefully when everyone can receive a vaccine we can see our families and friends again!
1/1	Thank you, these informative communications are always useful and welcome. At the same time I think that at the moment the critical part is to find ways to expedite production and administration of the vaccines. There are many willing to get the shot that still need to wait. #iamhere
1/0	Thank you. And they are trying their best to convince us that a fast track is going to be safe. If true, that means that all the long-term studies that have been done (and required by law) have been for nothing. Either that, or they are feeding us a load of lies, due to the enormous amount of money involved in the ones who can do this first, second and third. Let them take the money incentive away completely, and we will see a complete collapse of experimental vaccines for Covid 19. Human lives are nothing compared to money.
0/0	Thank you. But what about its effect on old people. There are evidence in some countries that it is causing death to them. You should be transparent and clarify more.
1/1/0	Thank you. I needed this broken down simply and you achieved that.
1/1	Thank you. Thank you scientists, lab techs, logistics professionals, truck drivers and all involved in this Herculean effort.
1/1	Thank you... I feel encouraged to now get the vaccine
1/1	Thank your covid-19 vaccine explanation clearly . Congratulations üôè for your health education over world üåè wide. Good luck doctor & Happy Sweet December üéÑ

1/1	Thanks be toGod for vaccine
0/0	Thanks but no thanks, I'll focus on health instead
0/0	Thanks but no thanks. Inherent immune systems in the healthy do quite well.
1/1	Thanks doctor for this video...and also giving us assurance..regarding this vaccine...
0/0	Thanks for being a guinea pig. I have some other products needing testing... interested?
1/1/1/1	Thanks for everyone who commit themselves to make the covid-19 vaccine!
1/1	Thanks for getting vaccinated. Hope everyone does when they get the chance. I‚Äôm a little nervous but I will definitely do it.
1/1	Thanks for posting this! How exciting. If I were healthy I‚Äôd‚Äôve volunteered. But I‚Äôm fat, old, and partially blind so I‚Äôm sure they wouldn‚Äôt have wanted me.
1/1	Thanks for saving all those lives.
1/1	Thanks for sharing and giving a good example. My 2 sons in the frontline also got theirs. Those who are scared of the vaccine I ask - How many died from COVID19 ? 350,000 +. How many from the vaccine ? Zero. It's a no brainer.
1/-1	Thanks for sharing your experience! :) Hope you have a happy and healthy new year!
1/1	Thanks for sharing your informations to educate people !!!! ....I saluted W.H.O
1/1	Thanks for the article. I agree. I have had the COVID, but will take the vaccine when it is available. We should be grateful that we live in a country such as this, where we have wealth and great companies. My wife is from Colombia and it will be a long time before they get the vaccine.
1/1	Thanks for the great informative video and effort! But ... god makes the comment section my brain hurt sigh
1	Thanks for the info. Me and my Mom will be getting our first injections of the Moderna tomorrow.
1/1	Thanks for the info...will be getting mine soon, need to protect not only myself but my children and grandchildren. Side affects seem small compared to risk of death.
1/1	Thanks for the post! Especially grateful for the note about how we aren‚Äôt bragging with our post-vax selfies but being¬†#vaccinesafetyadvocates! I got my 1st dose today (student social worker here) and so far no side effects bar a slightly sore arm. Hope you‚Äôre feeling much better!!
1/1	Thanks for this highly educational video. I‚Äôm gonna share as much as I can and people can understand how the vaccine can protect everyone
1/1	Thanks for this video :) really hoping this gets out soon
1/1	Thanks for this video ?? vaccine is here already and it‚Äôs rolling great.
1/1	Thanks for this... this science is awesome.
1/1	Thanks from everyone for doing this!
1/1	Thanks so much for this excellent explanation! You‚Äôre doing a real service to the community. Keep up the great work.
1/1	Thanks so much for this in-depth analysis of these vaccines. Your work is highly appreciated.
1/-1	Thanks so much for your informative easy to understand lectures. I've been following since early in the pandemic. Still taking vitamin D!
1/1	Thanks to Norway and Prime Minister @erna_solberg for their ongoing leadership in global health and important investments in vaccines.
1	Thanks to World Health Organization: your hard work for r safety and wellness of all human beings is important. The vaccines are safe and vaccination is the only way to get out from this tragic pandemic. Thanks and go on!! ‚ù§

1/1	Thanks to my dear friend and colleague Rep. Barbara Cooper for leading by example. Please get vaccinated when able. #COVID19 #CovidVaccine
1/1	Thanks to our fantastic teams across Wales, more than 500,000 people have been vaccinated. Every vaccine's a small victory.
1/1	Thanks to scientists, government & private sector, my mother got her COVID vaccine today. No pain or fatigue. Just protection & peace of mind.
0/0	Thanks, but I will refuse any of them.
0/0	Thanks, this only confirms that C-19 vaccines can be dangerous
0/0	Thanks. but knowing what big pharma is capable of. I think I'll just use battery acid instead!
1/1	Thankyou Doctor.... Really true ..i have also taken vaccination on the same day you have... My experience is same all good ...Ashwani Unicef..
0/0	That 1/2 dose by "error" seems very sketchy. I would want to see how they justify it in the paper.
0/0	That could be a paper card ‚Äì or a tiny tattoo on their arm, invisible to the naked eye but readable by an infrared scanner. This technology already exists and has been tried on live animals and human cadaver skin, said researcher Ana Jaklenec at [MIT] Their method uses micro-needle patches that can deliver both the vaccine and a squirt of an invisible ink under the person‚Äôs skin, storing the vaccination record.
1/1	That disease killed millions of people every day, it needs to be stopped
0/-1	That doesnt sound socialist/communist does it? Either take our sham vaccine for the scam C19 OR you go on a list of dangerous subversives who we will lock out of society.
0/0	That effin vaccine killed my mother today. She was fine before getting it. Do not take it EVER
0/0	That is a definite no to the vaccine. I will rely on my immune system and the good Lord.
1/1	That is awsomeüëåüèºüëåüèºüëåüèºi wish Denmark were more effective. We are sooooo slow hereü§õüèæü§õüèæü§õüèæü§õüèæü§õüèæonly about70.000 have received the vaccine hereüôÑ
1/1	That is great news. This man is a world treasure.
1/1	That is really good news wow there is some negative comments bout the vaccine but I think it‚Äôs a great break through and I will defo have it I‚Äôm a care assistant for elderly people with dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs and diabetic so I think it makes sense
0/0	That is the definition of stupidity. We gave you a vaccine that we know nothing about, in fact take two doses and we will wait and see how it works out. Ahhh stupidity has no bounds
1/1	That is the finding of all Vaccines, there is always the potential of a side effect, but there is also risk in a car accident on your way to work, and generally that risk is much higher.
0/0	That is the numbers they will admit-it is definitely MUCH higher, and many of those died within a couple of hours of vaccination AND STILL NONE LINK THE DEATH TO THE VACCINE. This guy is nothing but a vaccine shill-his advice will surely get people killed. Any doctor etc promoting this toxic crap should be banned from practice. Its murder, plain and simple.
0/0	That is the problem. Any death induced by vaccine will be shown as unrelated death on papers. U dont take a chance with life like this. It is not russian roulette. Authorities should be careful and approve vaccines only after proper trials and not under political pressure
0/0	That is who committed the murder, their poison
1/1	That isn't true, maybe the vaccine was rushed but that they would give an another disease to it's people is just dumb, we're in a middle of a pandemic. Causing an another one won't be beneficial.
1/-1	That lady saying she got into researching vaccines because her kid was immunodeficient. Aren‚Äôt we telling people to vaccinate their kids because we want to protect those immunodeficient people and people who might have allergies to chemicals in the vaccines?
1/1	That makes me very happy. I was getting depressed thinking the vaccine may not work on the new variants. Science comes through again!!! Please let this be over
1/1	That means, Coronavirus will end soon!
1/1	That might be a good idea! Why have they waited this long?
0/-1	That vaccine is the mark of the beast believe it or not.
0/0	That vaccine we know is a mark of the beast,we better die of corona than going to hell
0/0	That was the point of the vaccine, get rid of the old people.
1/-1	That would be absolutely fine, fantastic deal. Nearly 100% survival rate and doesn't make the majority of people bedridden like other flus. As a matter of fact, you need a test forced upon you to see if you have it. Give me the papers, I'll be the first to sign.
1/1	That's a smart announcement - it incentivizes citizens to go get vaccinated, and gives the tourism industry some sort of a timeline for restart so they're not completely left in the dark, like in many other countries.
1/1	That's awesome! One step closer to having an actual vaccine!!
1/1	That's bad. I hope Health Canada approves both the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines soon.
1/1	That's concerning. I would not want to get medical care from someone who doesn't want the vaccine. Not just from a Covid perspective, but because I wouldn't trust their judgment.
1/1	That's good. We really dropped the ball in containing the virus but at least we're doing good on vaccinations.
1/1	That's great, especially considering the infection rate also provided some immunity as well. So, there are two competing immunity processing going on.
1/1	That's incredible. Most vaccines aren't that effective. I believe that's much more effective than even the measles vaccine. And they sprinted a marathon to get this done in record time.
1/-1	That's interesting to know. But the title of your video is miss leading. Please remember that people in the UK will watch this, the Oxford vaccine is a different type.
1/0	That's just classic "your immune system is responding" side effects. Probably less common in older individuals because of their less active immune systems.
0/0	That's me. I want NOTHING to do with coronavirus vaccine
0/0	That's nice. Still not getting one. The one time I got the flu shot is the one time I got the flu. I'm not chancing Covid
0/-1	That's not good
1/1/1	That's really good efficacy for the first generation of usable vaccine. That chart says it all. Guess I am going to take it
1/-1	That's the reaction I get from the mundane flu shot. I think it's more of a physical reaction to getting your arm jabbed through the muscle with a sharp piece of metal, than any biological or chemical reaction to the needle's contents.
0/-1	Thats a whole lotta trust issues
0/0	Thats one way they can reduce the population to half a billion.
1/1	Thats the other joke. Its all on the little white leaflet no-one reads. Its hardly a conspiracy! Medicines have side effects because they have effects. The only "medicine" with no side effects is homeopathy. Tap water doesn't cause allergies. Unfortunately it offers no protection against viruses either.
0/0	That‚Äôll be the Nano technology in your system changing your DNA bruv. good luck to you
0/0	That‚Äôs I don‚Äôt take vaccines or my kids they lie too much
0/0	That‚Äôs a definite NO from me!
1/1	That‚Äôs a scientific miracle!!!BRAVOO!
1/1	That‚Äôs amazing I am glad all the frontline people are getting the vaccine. Thank you for helping us.
0/0	That‚Äôs exactly my reasoning. I believe in vaccines but I‚Äôm not willing to take a new and experimental one
0/-1	That‚Äôs exactly my reasoning. I believe in vaccines but I‚Äôm not willing to take a new and experimental one. Thankfully I probably won‚Äôt have to either since I live in Taiwan and things are fine here
0/0	That‚Äôs exactly what I was thinking like I just want to wait to for more testing until I take it
1/-1	That‚Äôs fine as long as you don‚Äôt infect others if you get the virus were you vaccinated as a child or have you ever taken illegal drugs what do they contain
1/1	That‚Äôs fine, let them indulge themselves in their own stupidity. More vaccines for the rest of us
0/0	That‚Äôs good you can give my vaccine to someone else because I am not having it
1/1	That‚Äôs obvious bullshit. mRNA vaccines are safe and effective and unless you are enjoying the pandemic, you should get vaccinated as soon as you are eligible.
1/0	That‚Äôs one of my concerns. If this vaccine won‚Äôt give you long term immunity, what good will it be and how close are they to finding this out without exposing the test subject to actual active Covid?
1/1	That‚Äôs relieving to hear. Most of my coworkers and family are either antivax or narcissists and will not get vaccinated.
1/1	That‚Äôs relieving to hear. Most of my coworkers and family are either antivax or narcissists and will not get vaccinated. At work today, our company was notifying us that we have free flu shot vouchers that we can print and use at any pharmacy. This lady said ‚ÄúThe mRNA contains aborted fetus cells and i am a Christian I unfortunately can‚Äôt be pro life and pro vax at the same time.‚Äù A couple people agreed with her. Where did this aborted fetus cells shit come from?! I simply cannot understand how a person gets to the point where they believe something like that.
1/-1	That‚Äôs so frustrating to hear. Everyone around me is antsy to get the vaccine. It‚Äôs hard that so much supply is held up on 1A
1/1	That‚Äôs what being anti science does to you... it rots your brain!
0/0	That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt won‚Äôt it l had covid and survived without the vaccine
0/0	That‚Äôs why I won‚Äôt trust that vaccine. If they want to withhold initial side effects information, what are they not telling about that rapidly developed vaccine
1/-1	The "EBOLA" vaccine is for only one strain and clinical studies have yet to be conducted.
0/0	The "vaccine" has absolutely NOTHING to do with the imaginary virus. It is all about the Khazar New World Order tyranny. It is one stage of the mark of the beast.
0/0	The "vaccines" are NOT "vaccines" but rather gene therapy, which has never been used before. They brand new technology and have not undergone Phase 3 clinical trials and is not approved by the FDA. It is impossible to say they are "safe and effective." Already, severe side effects and deaths reported to the VAERS (vaccine adverse events reporting system are well over 15,000, and it is estimated only 1% of adverse events are even reported.
0/0	The 40-year-old man in AstraZeneca's developed acute neuro encephalopathy. Before that incident, a trial volunteer¬†developed¬†symptoms of transverse myelitis. It's a rare debilitating neurological disorder¬†linked¬†to vaccines. In September, a trial¬†paused¬†after¬†another participant¬†in the U.K. got the same symptoms. In October,¬†a participant in Brazil died. What's more shocking is that MHRA expects people to suffer from COVID-19 vaccines.
1/1	The AstraZeneca vaccine is based on very well known, proven and trusted vaccine that just has been adapted to SARS-CoV-2. Don‚Äôt believe in what the media tells. The vaccine works properly fine.
1	The AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine is actually a viral vector vaccine. It is a DNA virus, but it is pretty different from an actual DNA vaccine.
0/0	The COVID vaccines I would never take or give to my family
0/0	The COVID vaccines don‚Äôt prevent infection; they lessen symptoms just like taking vitamin C, vitamin D and Zinc.
1/1	The COVID vaccines that are available fit the profile of vaccines that are generally safe during pregnancy
1/-1	The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread suffering. In order to alleviate these harms, it is critical that a solution be found to the pandemic as quickly as possible.
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccination will help keep you from getting the virus.
1/-1	The COVID-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca showed 76% efficacy against symptomatic infection for three months after a single dose, with greater effectiveness when a second is given later, according to a study.
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for people who are actively being treated for cancer
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for pregnant women, a group in which the risk of severe COVID-19 is substantial,
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine, when it exists, will be one of the ones that both I and my doctor consider absolutely necessary.
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccines are not only safe, they're life-saving. Trust the experts, trust your community, and trust the one million people who have already had it. When your time comes, take the vaccine. @SGadiLondon
1/-1	The COVID19 pandemic has made me realized we‚Äôve been living under a mental health pandemic for a long time.
0/-1	The Covid "vaccine" is not a vaccine in the traditional sense.
1/1	The Covid Vaccine has undergone rigorous tests that are globally recognised as having the highest safety standard.
0/1	The Covid was intentionally put out to depopulate us. Next they are going to hire thugs to cause riots, and cause a civil war. Open your eyes people. Biden is in bed. With China. They are trying to institute a new world order, and turn us into communists. The first step in communism is censorship.
0/0	The Covid-19 Vaccine is going to turn into the new flu vaccine, except your going to be taking both and they still won't work.
1/-1	The Dr. Are taking it, so if you don't want to take it's find, but stop scarring everybody.
0/-1	The EU have dug a great big hole for themselves. Their incompetence is astounding, so no wonder this federal organisation is hated. Read the article in Spiegel International about VDL and the EU's incompetence and get yourself educated.
0/0	The Entire history of vaccines show that MOST problems and dangers come 2 years later..
0/-1	The FDA says common side effects, in Pfizer's clinical trial involving some 44,000 people, included pain where they got the shot,¬†fatigue, headache,¬†chills, fever, and¬†joint¬†and muscle pain.
1/0	The Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) has announced it has approved a herbal medicine - Cryptolepis sanguinolenta - locally known as Nibima for clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19, after a "detailed assessment".

1/1	The Leader in Canada announced that Pfizer's vaccine is coming and it will be Free to all Canadians. Love my country.
0/0	The MRNA covid19 vaccine contains Nanobots (see Neuralink & bitchute. com). There are concerns of sterilisation. Bill gates plan is depopulation. Please be AWAKE
0/-1	The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency(MHRA) regulates medicines in the U.K. MHRA excepts that the will be many COVID-19 vaccine side effects.¬†The organization posted a bid for an A.I¬†system to track the expected flood of COVID-19 vaccine injuries.¬† MHRA said that: The MHRA urgently seeks an Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) software tool to process the expected high volume of COVID-19 vaccine Adverse Drug Reaction (ADRs) and ensure that no details from the ADRs' reaction text are missed
0/0	The Moderna and Pfizer Vaccines are Bill Gates/Dr Fauci scams. In Florida hundreds of old people are dying after getting their jab. I refuse to take it. I will wait for the data just like the 70% of the Hospital personnel are doing.
1/1	The NHS has approved it. Health Canada has approved it. My brother and his girlfriend are both scientists (they don‚Äôt study in vaccines specifically but there both super smart and do their research) and there both gonna get the vaccine. That‚Äôs good enough for me.
1/1	The National Drug Authority as part of their achievements has closed more than 600 unlicensed health facilities and impounded medicines from unqualified personnel and poorly kept places following the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic.
1/1	The New Zealand data showed that the most commonly reported reasons to get vaccinated were to protect family and self, with safety being the chief concern about the vaccine.
1/1	The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine already had its 3rd trial which supports its positive results elsewhere in the World..why hasn't the FDA given emergency approval for this vaccine as they have Pfizer & Moderna????
1/1	The Oxford vaccine accidently discovered that a half dose followed by a full dose gave 90% immunity. I wonder whether two half doses could do the same or even create higher immunity still. If this were the case it would release more of the vaccine for global use and reduce the reaction caused from the vaccination Qantas has announced it will only carry those who are vaccinated - good news
1/1	The Oxford vaccine was built off of MERS and SARS research, if you've got even a bit of a pre-existing template to work with then it's not going to take years.
1/1	The Pfeizer vaccine works - its relatively simple. Just need the new variants RNA to produce and can be quickly turned around
1	The Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines are extremely safe, with some mild expected side effects, says the UK's drugs regulator

0/-1	The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says the most common side effects of the Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are:injection site pain and swelling, fatigue, headache, chills and fever
1/1	The UK government have decided to increase the time adminstered between the 1st and 2nd doses, instead relying on a slightly less efficacy rate of the 1st dose, but to cover a much wider population. This plan in different to many other countries but studies suggest this approach should pay off. The 1st graph only takes into account countries who have admininstered BOTH does, and therefore doesnt quite give the wider picture to reflect the UK's approach. The UK adminstered 600,000 doeses on a single day over the weekend.
1/1	The UK vaccination program is probably the only thing the government had done well during this pandemic. If the numbers continue the way that they are going, the 15 million people in the top four most vulnerable groups will be vaccinated a week before schedule.
0/-1	The US Rollout hasnt been smooth. Me a Canadian: You guys are getting vaccines?
1/1	The US should move to immediately approve this vaccine. The EU and UK have, these aren't 3rd world countries. They don't know anything the US doesn't.
0/0	The Vaccine ain‚Äôt a vaccine. It‚Äôs an experimental biological agent that is killing people....but more importantly will kill many more as a result of ‚ÄòAntibody Dependent Enhancement‚Äô....you‚Äôll die later!
0/0	The Vaccine is to control u and kill u so they can have power
0/0	The Vaccine will Really Mess you Up!
0/0	The WHO hasn't approved it!
1/1	The amount of anti-vax and anti-quarantine sentiment I see getting lots of likes in YouTube comments on other videos concerns me. People don't understand that the reason media hypes it up is because the younger population often go symptomless when they carry covid-19 and then they think people are overreacting. The reality is that the wreckless symptomless carriers can directly or indirectly spread the virus to vulnerable populations that show symptoms (i.e. the elderly) and that is the problem. On top of this, anti-vaxxers claim the vaccine is a death sentence despite deaths caused after vaccination being extremely low*. The vaccine is safe and particularly in younger individuals, there are side effects that appear after the second dose such as headache, fever, and muscle aches**.
1/1	The amount of people commenting negativity about the vaccine killing them are the same people who eat chips, cake and drink coke for breakfast, binge drink alcohol and other drugs I‚Äôm sure.
1/1	The amount of people commenting negativity about the vaccine killing them are the same people who eat chips, cake and drink coke for breakfast, binge drink alcohol and other drugs I‚Äôm sure.

0/0	The answer is no and anyone who tries to force it on me I will fight them to the death it is that simple .

1/1	The best is the COVID vaccine is effective and safe, while some of the side effects do need more time to be seen. Hope everyone stays safe during this pandemic.
1/1	The best thing is after I‚Äôve had my vaccine, if I become asymptotic and pass it it on to one of those anti-Vaxers who end up dead, I‚Äôll sleep just fine
0/0/0/0	The biggest question is, why are you trying to force something on me I don't want?
0/-1	The biggest scam in human history! Ever! Fucking control freaks! I'm not happy! Unless they can Guarantee 100% complete safety with this bull Sh!t im not having a vacation fuck them..
0/0	The broad application of experimental mRNA transfections against SARS-CoV-2 is a violation of the Nuremberg Code.
1/1	The child-survival-rate has drastically increased after the invention of vaccines. Every child that dies from measels is a child that could have lived a long and happy life, if the person that infected them would have been vaccinated.
1/-1	The clear truth is they could have done this months ago, but people were not worth minimal business risk.
0/0	The clinical trials that were suppose to run for 3 years were cut short at 6 months and they got emergency use authorization. And as she said, the trials now continue in you the reciepient. So if you want to be a lab rat, go for it. I will wait for 2 years.
1/1	The combination of getting vaccinated and following CDC recommendations to protect yourself and others provides the best protection from COVID-19.

0/0	The covid 19 vaccines are killing and maming people this is a fact! How about telling people they may expect death or disability after their vaccineü§îüêëüíâ‚ò†
0/-1/0	The covid mutation is far more rapid than the vaccination.
1/1	The covid vaccine hasn‚Äôt killed a single person. NOT taking the vaccine has killed more americans than the second world war.
0/0	The covid vaccine is not a vaccine but an insidious method of genetic manipulation. If "gene therapy" sounds scary to you, it should.
0/0	The covid vaccine is the ultimate IQ test. If your stupid enough to take the vaccine, your removed from the gene pool. If your brain and instincts are working and refuse the injected poison, you live to fight another day. It's that simple folks.
1/1	The covid vaccine will save us, it's for our safety and to ensure others are safe too. If you don't want to be vaccined because it may kill you think of others that might be affected by your disease. But there is one disease that is highly contagious and I believe you have it miss it's called stupidity
0/0	The covid vaccines are "Authorized for Emergency Use" by the FDA. "Authorized for Emergency Use" is not the same thing as "Approved"
0/0/0	The covid vaccines are "Authorized for Emergency Use" by the FDA. "Authorized for Emergency Use" is not the same thing as "Approved". Dr. Crotty uses the word "approved." The vaccine roll-out is an on-going study not yet "approved" by FDA.

1/1	The doctors and nurses and the team should all get a medal well done
0/0	The doctors will all tell you that their pharma drugs are safe. I was never told about the side effects before I received a hydrocortisone injection. You know what followed? Extreme muscular weakness, I became too weak to even ride a bike. Non-stop pain in my bones for months. Pain in my brain. Pressure in my chest and feeling like I was going to have a heart attack. You know what the doctors said? They all told me it was my imagination because "the drug takes 12 hours to leave your body." BS.
1/1	The doctors, nurses, and first responders, should get the vaccine first! Followed by older Americans.
0/1	The entire process went faster than usual for explainable reasons
1/1	The entire process went faster than usual for explainable reasons, but still followed the usual steps for testing and review. There is no risk with the vaccine ‚Ä¶
0/0	The entire vaccine machine is built on lies of omission and fraudulent science.. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS quietly paid out by NVICP to vaccine injured people, but the overwhelming majority of vaccine injuries are never even REPORTED. OF the thousands reported, only a tiny few are compensated. therefore, the real numbers of dollars that should have been paid out to vaccine injured people is in the TRILLIONS.
0/0	The expert opinion I listen to is from Dr Michael Yeadon. He hasn't been bought.
0/-1	The eyes of the two readers move to the right side and left from time to time. This indicate lying.

0/0	The fact that it has aborted babies lung whatever in it....NOPE, not getting it! Got my flu shot but refuse the COVID.
1/1	The fact that scientists have managed to produce several highly effective vaccines in such a short time period is astounding.We are lucky to have it available soon. I will take it first chance I get. That anyone would hesitate getting it is incomprehensible.
0/0	The fact that they've developed a vaccine within a year is a curse and not a miracle, old boy.
1/1	The fact that we are all waiting on 1 or 2 vaccine manufacturing places to crank out vaccines is ridiculous. They should have had 10 of these spun up and ready to go.
1/1	The fact the ymca has now had a covid case and I‚Äôm still hearing people say they won‚Äôt get the vaccine. Plz just fucking get it I don‚Äôt want covid coz I passed someone in the corridor who‚Äôs been partying because ‚Äúcovid is a hoax and the vaccine has dead baby‚Äôs in‚Äù
0/0	The fact they want to vaccinate every person on the planet proves this has nothing to do with COVID. A virus with a 99.9% recovery rate doesn‚Äôt call for worldwide vaccination on this scale. So what‚Äôs in these vaccines that‚Äôs so important they want everyone to have one?
0/0	The facts are that: 1. The MelesiaAirliness plane shot down over Ukraine was aimed at scientists who were to present a plan for depopulation of the population and parts in Sydney !!! 2.5G + virus vaccine will add height. Torsion, morphogenetic fields can insert, remove ports into or from the aid genome by means of ninformation fields and the pcr polymerase chain reaction. Prof. Luc Montegnier, who discovered HIV portions with the Boleria burgdorferi genome. 3. Bill Clinton said that there are too many people and we should be around 1 billion, Gates says there should be 500 million. Please check the interviews with them. 5. Warming of the external climate - drought and lack of food. 6. Please check why 2.3 million women in Africa are infertile after tetanus vaccination !!!! 7. Please check or exploit from monkeys implanted in the US. This virus wakes up after 40 years causing disease. 8. If flu is a matting virus, why has there been no effective vaccine for it for years? Why don't they vaccinate people who are severely vaccinated
0/0	The fake "vaccine" does exactly what it was designed to do. Virtually all sane people know that COVID-19 is a hoax perpetrated by the Jew World Order.
1	The faster we get 75% of this country vaccinated, the faster we end COVID and the sooner everything returns to normal
0/0	The fastest created vaccine in history? Hmm smth stinks like the ones who created the virus are also curing it
0/0	The fatality rate of the vaccine looks to overtake covid, in healthy people nonetheless.
0/-1	The few workers naive enough to take the vaccine are not the majority in Sweden, which has basically achieved herd immunity by rejecting economic lockdowns and facemasks.
1/-1	The first challenge is going to be getting 40% of the population to take it after the first 60% who wants vaccines is done being vaccinated.
0/0	The first flu vaccination was 70 years ago. We still have flu today and keep vaccinating. Eventually we will become GMO people with short life.
1/1	The first people who show get the Vaccine (if they want it) not forced, should be the elderly and people at high risk with underlying issues.
0/0	The flu is more dangerous to me, and I don't take the flu shot either. Also because there is next to no risk.
0/0	The flu shot made me sick last time I got one. No vaccines for me.
0/-1	The following side effects have also been reported: muscle, and joint pain, delayed swelling, redness or a rash at the injection site
0/0	The frail and elderly were not included in these vaccine trials. IMO, giving it to them now is MURDER!
1/1	The globe functions as one whether we agree or not. Neglecting to extend vaccinations to developing countries will not rid the world from this horrendous pandemic...Traveling sums it up. Therefore, get to work.
1/1	The goal of the vaccine is to prevent death and hospitalizations because of Covid.
0/0	The good Jesus gave me an immune system.. don‚Äôt need your poison.. keep it
0/0	The good old brainwashing machine is at it again calling the truth lies. Need to question who‚Äôs profiting from the vaccine? The very people pushing it. Human guinea pigs. Please read the ingredients!
1/1	The good thing about this is that most scientists and medical professionals will get the vaccine. These are the people we want around.
0/0	The gov does not care about you.... they only care about money & power.
0/0	The government is running a scam on us. They take the numbers of deaths from cancer, the flu, and other diseases and label them all as covid deaths instead. This way, the death rates seem way up, when in reality, the deaths of this year are the same as last year, and the year before. (Within 15,000 difference). They outlawed known cures such as hydroxizine and fire the doctors who perscribe it. The whole thing's a hoax to initiate the new world order. How we can stop it is by banding together and spreading the word. Stay safe, god bless, do not consent, do not take the vaxx. Also, last i checked these videos had a like to dislike ratio of 1 to 10. They keep resetting the dislikes. Do not be duped into this illusion they expect us to believe.
0/0	The government should just suspend all these nonsense vaccines lot people are recovering now we have less than 80,000 active cases so far
0/0	The government will scam people. They don't care. The side effects are horrible and fatal. My neighbor who was a 85 year old woman died 15 days after covid vaccine. Its sad but this is the truth. It's all about trillions $$$ selling the vaccine not about our lives.
0/0	The greatest lie ever told is that vaccines are gonna stop this pandamic
0/0	The greatest lie ever told is that vaccines are safe and effective
0/1	The group of doctors in Houston that administered Ivermectin presented much data. And a drastic reduction in deaths. Since Ivermectin has been FDA approved for decades and have little to no side effects, why would it hurt to prescribe as a prophylactic? It won‚Äôt hurt. And may very well help.
0/0/0	The guy said mRNA have not been relatively used before, actually mRNA vaccines have never been used before covid
0	The harder you work at trying to change people's minds where this vaccine is concerned the more suspicious of it they are going to become. People's feelings should be respected and we should use plants for medicine not chemicals.
0/0/0	The health department order is for you not to think too much about your personal self preservation against being injected with there poison for the greater good of EXPERTS
1/1	The healthcare system I work for has already vaccinated over 5,900+ employees, providers and vendors out of a roughly 8,000 person workforce. The remaining ones either don‚Äôt want it or are waiting to see how others fare with the vaccines first or they‚Äôre not permitted to get the vaccine due to them having just recovered from COVID. A few weeks ago we had almost 500 employees out with COVID or quarantining due to exposure and just a day ago that number was down to below 100. Our COVID patients went from over 400 at its worst to 285 as of yesterday and this includes patients who have recovered from COVID but are still too sick to get discharged. So yes, vaccines do really work in my opinion.
0/0	The history they feed us is lies, no vaccine is good for you. They are designed to be harmful.
1/1	The hospital I work for just went a full week with no new COVID cases among staff for the first time since Feb 2020. Very cool to see the vaccine in action
1/1	The hospital I work for just went a full week with no new COVID cases among staff for the first time since Feb 2020. Very cool to see the vaccine in action. Edit: This is with 75% of employees having received one dose and 65% having received both doses.
1/-1	The idea was to vaccinate 60-70% of adults by September, the target which will be reached, but then the vaccination became the competition, which will ultimately affect the poor countries the most. The target of 85% is unrealistic simply because of the anti-vax movement. You don't have that amount of people willing to take the vaccine, not to mention they won't let their children taking the one. It's all about making the argument against the EU, and the EU is affected by this, even though they should ignore this.
1/1	The incredible rate of discovery and development is testament to what can be achieved through collaboration. It would be incredible post covid (getting ahead of myself) if the same vigorous approach could be applied to other prevalent diseases especially those affecting third world countries.
1/1	The known and potential benefits of a COVID-19 vaccine must outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccine for use under what is known as an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
0/0	The larger point is you don‚Äôt vaccinate people for a virus that kills .002%. Has a 99.997% survival rate. Clearly something else is going on. Clearly the vaccine isn‚Äôt safe.
0/0	The last time I had a flu vaccine I got really sick. I haven't had one since. Realize the vaccine is for other people so even if it kills you, it protects other people from YOU. I've never had a bad case of the flu until I had a vaccine. I'll wait at least 1 year before taking this one.
0/0	The last time I took a vaccine it caused a severe allergic reaction. I could have almost died. I'd rather bet my life on the 'flu' than an untested vaccine put out by large greedy corporations.
0/0	The last time there was a mass vaccination program in the US was the 1976 swine flu outbreak, where the vaccine program had to be stopped after 25% already were vaccinated because it was paralyzing and killing people. Gerald Ford even went on television to take the vaccine and encourage it. Since then, Congress has passed new laws that vaccine companies have no liability to be sued if they produce bad vaccines that kill people. Making the vaccine mandatory is irresponsible considering it‚Äôs already troubled history.
0	The law should change , Force them to take the Vaccine or stay in jail for 5 yrs lol
1/1	The level of ignorant, self-important reasons, delusional reasons why people are refusing to take the vaccine is truly appalling. On the other hand, good. Step aside. More vaccine available for the rest of us who look at evidence for decision making. As long those people do not interfere with my ability to get vaccinated hey, go ahead, get sick.
1/-1	The mRNA COVID vaccines are safe, effective and cannot give you COVID.
0/0	The mRNA in the vaccine tells the cells to create a protein that stops the fertility of the virus that will effect your fertility also you wont get kids,
1/1	The mRNA vaccines cannot alter your DNA. The ingredients of the vaccine do not enter your cell's nucleus, which is where your DNA is stored. Instead, the vaccine simply offers instructions to your cells. Your cells read the instructions, and then they create antibodies against the spike protein found on the SARS-COV-2 virus. The instructions that were sent in the vaccine simply fall apart and disappear.
1/-1	The mRNA vaccines had 100% antibody response. When AstraZeneca was reporting actual numbers the antibody quantities were less and the T-cell response seemed unremarkable. Was not a good day for their stock. Their primate study was not encouraging (Oxford being where the vaccine comes from, I think even going back to SARS, MERS, whatever a similar attempt was let's call it mixed). I think people are being misled, not nefariously but context is lacking. We'll see what the phase 3 results are. I would be shocked if that vaccine is 90% effective and would wonder for how long it would hold up. Maybe it meets a threshold but I wouldn't compare it to the two mRNA vaccines and just expect the same result.
1/1	The magic of science. I‚Äôm hoping that we have finally turned the corner
0/0	The main concern about the COVID-19 vaccines has been among people with a severe allergic reaction to polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polysorbate
1/-1	The main problem lies in production, but not budget.
0/0	The main reason for not wanting to take it is suspicion that all the safety data is not available, and that the vaccine was rushed to production.
1/1	The main reason you should get vaccinated is to not get seriously ill.
1/1	The majority of mothers regarded vaccinations as an efficient method of children protection against infectious diseases.
0/0	The majority of people don‚Äôt even need the vaccine.
0/0	The makers of the vaccine and the government accept that a small percentage will either be grossly injured by the vaccine or die from it. That is business as usual for them, to lose a few for the "greater" good.
1/0	The media coverage misinformation, government bureaucracy, and peoples' unrealistic expectations and lack of patience based on the logistical difficulties. Please stop telling the general public they can get a covid vaccine at any local pharmacy; let us handle things when we actually secure said product and stop wasting everyones' time giving people false information about where/when people can get covid vaccinations.
1/1	The media in the United States keeps making headlines like "It's only 66% effective!" When in reality, it's 85% effective against severe coronavirus and 100% effective against death and it's been tested against all the new strains.
0/0	The media is so manipulative trying to make it seem like this is the best thing since sliced bread. i‚Äôm not getting this vaccine!
1/1	The mild illness caused by the attenuated vaccine is exactly what makes it so effective. This is the closest thing we had to ‚Äúnatural immunity‚Äù.
1/0	The moment anti vaxx say vaccines cause autism that's when I plug my ears and compassion goes out the window
1/1	The more important reason is that I consider it a duty to my patients, most of whom are elderly. My temperature gets checked every day that I work, but I‚Äôm young, and there is a chance I could be asymptomatic even if affected. The last thing I would want is to unwittingly infect my patient. It‚Äôs my worst nightmare. Even the thought of it mortifies me.I will get vaccinated at my earliest opportunity.
0/0	The more it (vaccination) is supported by public authorities, the more will its dangers and disadvantages be concealed or denied
0/-1	The more people that take this poison the faster we rid the worlds of the weak dumb ass sheeple

0/0	The most rushed vaccine in human history? You're damn right I'm not getting it.
0/-1	The narcotics drug distributors would have done the better job than the states.
0/0	The negative impact of this so what called "vaccine" is far way more than the positive ones!
1/1	The news of the vaccine was a much needed morale boost for the UK, and so far it‚Äôs going to plan.
1/1	The number 1 reason we are living longer is due to life extending medicines. These are manufactured by pharmaceutical companies, such as Pfizer. Good luck if you don't plan on taking anything as you age.
1/1	The number of doses is not as relevant as when they are available. The Oxford vaccine may be ready in larger quantities before.
0/-1	The number of trial participants for UK/Br listed seems too low per the astrazenica website
0/0	The nurses at the hospital i work at that got the vaccination had to take days off of work from the side effects. Severe headaches, puking, feeling dead and lethargic
0/0	The nurses at the hospital i work at that got the vaccination had to take days off of work from the side effects. Severe headaches, puking, feeling dead and lethargic. I do not take it.
0/0	The one time I agree with anti-vaxxers is now
0/0	The ones getting it will be obliterated. We'll still be standing , because we don't listen to the PRESS. RIP
1/1	The only bad thing that vaccines have done is reduce certain diseases to mere distant memories, so people have forgotten how important vaccines are and how horrible those diseases were.
1/1	The only bad vaccine news is that no lab is producing them fast enough.
0/0	The only hold up now is to see what big pharma company can make the most money from it. Its all money. They don‚Äôt care about people's lives
1/-1	The only one getting immunity is Pfizer
0/0/1/0	The only one getting immunity is Pfizer.
0/0	The only one getting immunity is the manufacturer.
1/1/1	The only one happier than me completing my #CovidVaccine was my vaccinator! Three cheers for the volunteers Smiling face with smiling eyes (And volunteer if you can! We need as many as we can get!)
0/-1	The only problem I have with the vacs. are that the pharma companies were given immunity from prosecution before the people were given immunity from the virus.
1/1	The only remaining question is when can I get a dose?
1/1	The only side effect after receiving my COVID-19 vaccine is I speak fluent Spanish and I forgot how to drive a car. So my life is changing in new and exciting ways!
0/0	The only thing we have to fear is... the Vax itself
1/1	The only vaccine that I refuse to get is the flu vaccine.
1/1	The only vaccine that I refuse to get is the flu vaccine. Even time I get it, I get REALLY sick. My son seems to handle them fine.
0/0	The only way If i'd be sure is if Boris is in front of me and we have a wheel of vaccines, and we spin it, and I choose his Vaccine shot! then I wait 10months and watch his effects. What about Kids after? they may be Effected like before? Breathing issues? Fncking hell man.
1/1	The only way to stem the surge is through vaccination.
0/1	The other vaccines being developed will contain weakened or inactive forms of ‚Äúcommon cold‚Äù viruses, and substances commonly found in many vaccines.
0/1	The outrage at covid was everyone losing it with- we need to protect our elderly because we're killing people with life threatening illnesses in nursing homes. While locking people up & letting family die alone. Now the vaccine is good, it only kills frail patients.
1/1	The people in the comments show how uneducated humans really are, i mean comments like "i'd rather bet covid i don't trust the government!" and "No Vaccine for me id rather watch the simpsons they predicted it!". So fuxking stupid it's unreal
1/1	The people who are opposed to vaccines should drink disinfectant, like Trump told them to.
1/1	The people who think that these vaccines contain microchips are the same people who forget their phone passcode and blame the government for changing it.
0/0	The perfect situation they wanted us all in begging for this vaccine!
0/0	The person who goes to stick me will draw back a stump ! End of story
0/0	The pharmaceutical companies don‚Äôt care. They‚Äôre liability free to do human experiments. Hellooo Mc.Fly!
0/0	The pharmaceutical industry is liability free. Hmmm!!
0/0	The pifzer showing severe anaphylaxis and deaths??
1/1	The platform is new but it has been tested in multiple studies on more than 100,000 people at this point. I was in the Moderna study and it had little side effect and have not had COVID despite having some direct exposure to someone who had it. I have heard reluctance on it from some people and am curious about some of the hesitancy around it.
0/0	The point isn‚Äôt to stop transmission, it‚Äôs to inject genetic modification into the system.
1/1	The possibility of serious complications for anyone who gets the virus ‚Äî along with the public health consequences of the pandemic‚Äôs continuing its course ‚Äî are strong reasons in favor of getting vaccinated,
1/1	The prime objective is inoculating the population as fast as possible. Every vaccination benefits the population as a whole. Just get on with it. Don't waste time. If you're offered a vaccine it is your duty to take it. Period.
1/1	The problem is suspicion isn‚Äôt scientific proof. There‚Äôs a reason we don‚Äôt have smallpox anymore.
0/0	The problem with being against straight up toxins n poisons being injected into children??
0/0	The proof of it's poison is already known
0/0	The propaganda is so thick now, must be getting worried people will think for themselves about what they put in their own bodies
1/-1	The purpose of the vaccine is to get cured people‚Ä¶
0/0	The question is why the CEO of Pfizer doesnt want to take the vaccine?üòÑ
0/0	The question no one is asking is, why should trust without question a vaccin made by the company that paid the biggest fine for lying about side effect and not finish clinical test? Putting on the market drugs that cause people to go depress, cause inflammation and promote cancer growth in some patient
1	The question should be ‚Äúwhen are you taking the covid vaccine?‚Äù instead of ‚Äúare you taking the covid vaccine?‚Äù
1/1	The quickest thing we need to do if we really want to help the American people, is get this economy turned back on ‚Äî get people back to work, get kids back in school, get ourselves some herd immunity, get the vaccine distributed as quick as we can and get the uptake rate up
1/1	The rapid development of the #COVID19 vaccine is nothing short of a modern medical miracle.
1/1	The reaction won‚Äôt be death, which is many people‚Äôs reaction to catching covid!!!
1/1	The real good news in this update isn't the efficacy being a few percentage points higher than previously estimated but confirmation that it is working equally well in the elderly.
1/-1	The real thing is painful. Still have it until the 5th. I did everything right, Type 1 diabetic never went outside. Still got it. It's rough
1/1	The really important thing here is that we now have evidence that vaccines can be effective (in this case highly effective) against Covid. This means that we can now look to see good results coming out of other trials, especially those that don‚Äôt require storage at such low temperatures.
1/1	The reason for this moment I think is the incredibly complex nature of the working of immune system. And people don't understand it cause there is no simple way to make people understand their working to reassure them unless they have medical degree. And people always fear what they don't understand. It's easy to get misguided and misinterpreted the story if you don't understand the whole picture. It's not anti-vaxxers fault it's failure of awareness by government, failure of education
0/-1	The reason that Germany might be having difficulty with the rolling out of both the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines might be due to storing it at a cold temperature especially the Pfizer which needs to be stored at -70 degrees Celsius.
1/1	The research + work to get out this vaccine has been in progress for 17+ years. The goal now, today, is to at least, thru vaccination, minimize the amt. of cases that are bad enough to need hospitalization or lead to death. I am high risk. It'd kill me. Pls. vaccinate.
0/0	The results are scary. Say NO to vaccine
1/0	The risk is as high as bedrock
1/1	The risk of COVID is a bigger concern to me than the risk from the unknown around the vaccine.
1/1	The risk of a bad reaction from the vaccine is low.
1/1	The risk of a live virus vaccine is that you catch covid, which is also the risk you face if you don't get the vaccine. There's no way the vaccine will be approved if the risk is higher for getting the vaccine than it is from contracting it from the community. I don't understand your logic
1/0	The risks of adverse effects from catching COVID are much more severe and certain.
0/0	The rush to test an experimental biological agent (mRNA vaccine) on our first responders and military should have you very concerned.
0/0	The rush to test an experimental biological agent (mRNA vaccine) on our first responders and military should have you very very concerned.
0/0	The safest way to protect from Covid is nutrition and lifestyle, not an experiment gene therapy Frankenstein jab.
0/0	The same government that leaves schools open during a pandemic ? Yeah I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll pass
0/0/0	The same heavy metals that are in the vaccines they are now dumping on us by the ton from aircraft.
0/0	The same people bringing us these miracle vaccines have also long been advocating for a drastic reduction of the human population.
0/0	The same people encouraging vaccines are the same people that are trying to make all gmo food
1/1	The same way different people react differently to the same medication, different people react differently to the same vaccination. ‚Å£ Don't hesitate to take it at all!
0	The scariest vaccine on earth.
1/1	The science is absolutely incredible. But, how much in body testing is there? So cool that research has been in progress for so long to help stop the current pandemic. I will get it but I would rather be one of the later ones (I'm not at risk nor am I around anyone who is).
0/1	The science is great and vaccines are probably the greatest thing ever. The problem is instead of a multi year (5-10) clinical trial like normal vaccines go through, this brand new vaccine, using version 1 technology, was rushed through in 9 months. I'll wait. Thanks
1/1	The scientists woked hard in making a medicine to make this Corona virus go away. And I believe in them.
1/1	The second phase of the COVID-19 vaccination drive to cover the frontline Corona warriors will begin today in Gujarat.
1/0	The side affects may include being amune to covid 19
1/1	The side affects of vaccines are living longer
1/1	The side effects are being healthy
1/1	The side effects are temporary and minor. Ill take it
0/0	The side effects of the vaccine are the same symptoms you get with covid, a bit strange if you ask me
1/1	The side effects of the vaccine is gonna damage less people than Covid itself
0/0	The so called virus is just being used as a vector for the all important toxic vaccine.
1/1	The sooner everyone is vaccinated the sooner we can go back to normal
1/1	The sooner everyone is vaccinated, the sooner everyone gets back to drinking and business as usual.
1	The speed at which they've got these vaccines ready is nothing short of incredible
0/0	The spike protein in the virus turned out to be an easy target for the vaccines to attack. I don‚Äôt know why I would want to get sick to get immunity
0/0	The spread of Guillan Barre' syndrome will be rampant , with the advent of this vaccine.
0/1	The suppression of the anti-vaccine movement is not in line with how a free society should be operating.
0/0	The thought of knowingly infecting yourself with a disease is so frightening to me,
1/-1	The tinfoil on the internet. What a joke.
0/0	The toxic synthetic nanobot containing vaccine.
1/1	The tragedy in all this is that a good 30% of the population won‚Äôt want it because they saw some shitty anti-vaccine meme on Facebook. This pandemic has exposed the best of us and the worst of us.
1/1	The tragic thing is, by failing to get the vaccine, the pandemic deniers don‚Äôt just harm themselves: they harm responsible people, too.
1/1	The trials are done, what are you talking about? Phase 3 of the testing was done since July until December. There were more than 40,000 participants, half got the vaccine, the other half a placebo. There were no deaths. There was a 95% reduction of transmission in the vaccinated group (169 sick in the placebo group, only 9 in the vaccine group). There were 10 cases with severe symptoms in total, and only 1 was in the vaccinated group (same symptoms as you can get with Covid-19). The issues you're mentioning are appearing on people with allergies, which are already advised not to take the vaccine as well as immunocompromised people. They are relying on everyone else to protect them. Chance of getting serious side effects from the vaccine are unimaginably low compared to the benefits. The only reason you're subjective is because you're emotionally connected with the person in this video, but you can't even imagine what you'd think or how you'd feel if you were a medical worker and had to work with people who struggle to breathe every day.
0/0	The truth will come out about all vaccines after this poison
0/0	The truth will come out about all vaccines after this poison!
0/0	The vaccin is mRNA based ok? DNA is the recipe for your cells...DNA gives info to mRNA ok? mRna gives it to building your cells..ok? So if the vaccin changes your mRNA..it tells you what cells will be build..
1/1	The vaccination centre I work at recorded the most we‚Äôve done in a day yesterday. We absolutely smashed them out all day. Everyone was literally going as fast as they safely could all day. So many of the patients coming through everyday say things like, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let me hold you up! There are lots of people that need this after me!‚Äù It‚Äôs great that everyone is in it together! It‚Äôs also one of the few things in the country that‚Äôs actually going better than we expected!

0/0	The vaccine cannot save you from judgement day.
0/0	The vaccine companies can't be sued is another reason
1/-1	The vaccine course I‚Äôm currently taking is 1-2 hours per module...and it‚Äôs 16 modules long. I‚Äôm pretty sure that medical students cover that and probably more. So I never buy their bullshit about doctors not knowing anything.
1/1	The vaccine creates immunity..if you get covid after vaccination..with immunity in your body..you will fight the virus...vaccination doesn't mean you won't get virus again..its like any viral fever.
1/1	The vaccine development was moving faster than normal because the scientific community made it their top priority all over the world! Thank you for protecting American lives, CDC!!
1/1	The vaccine distribution is taking way too long
0/0	The vaccine doesn't even protect you from getting the wuflu all it does is lessen the effects. Life will never go back to normal unless this stupid man made virus stops being a political tool.
0/0	The vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent you from spreading covid so how are you protecting people?
1/1	The vaccine for covid-19 is our best chance to get back to a normal life.

0/0	The vaccine has killed perfectly healthy, smart, strong people far from elderly - men and women, almost immediately, What about that?
0/0	The vaccine has killed thousands already that mainstream news media refuses to cover. It has nano particles hat acts as an operating system. DO NOT GET THE VACCINE!!!!
0/0	The vaccine has not been tested long enough as we do not know what's a long term effect on our body will be that is why they test these vaccines for least 10 years before intimated and that no guaranteed that it will work on the mutant strains it was produced before the mutant strains was known I don't believe in all the government's information they are given to us not because I don't believe the government is more about the people trying to flog it off I will wait for a few years after the first 200000 people have had the vaccine to see what type of result it is
0/1	The vaccine has not taken any short-cuts based on safety.
1/1	The vaccine has side effects in less than 1 in a million people! You are much better of taking the vaccine than you are risking it with the virus! Not only that, if we are ever going to see the end of this pandemic enough people will have to get the vaccine!
0/0	The vaccine ingredients and side effects greatly out way the illness they claim to protect from. Natural antibodies from a healthy immune system should always be a choice.
0/0	The vaccine is a BIOWEAPON!

1/1	The vaccine is good for me
1/1	The vaccine is helping. The lockdowns is not as effective as in the past (British mutation?!).
0/-1	The vaccine is killing people that they killed young people to protect from the virus they could never control.
1/1	The vaccine is kinda like that friend that took the final early and can tell you what to study.
0/0	The vaccine is made by Bill Gates. I'm not taking it
0/0	The vaccine is made with aborted fetal tissue. And for all of these reasons I will never receive a coronavirus vaccine ever.
0/0	The vaccine is more of a threat to me and my family than covid. So I wont be taking it
1/1	The vaccine is not just slowing the spread, but even more importantly reducing the rate of deaths.
1/1	The vaccine is not likely to be harmful. It would increase your body‚Äôs immune response against the virus.
1/0	The vaccine is only 50% effective to avoid people getting the disease but 100% effective avoiding bad cases that need internation. This should have been explained better here!
1/1	The vaccine is only mandatory if you want to work or go to school again. Do your part. Don't be a deplorable vector.
0/0	The vaccine is poison!

1/1	The vaccine is safe. Period.
1/1	The vaccine is safer than getting covid itself, and at this point those are really the only options we have...
1/1	The vaccine is spreading 10x faster than the virus. Just waiting for me to catch it... The vaccine, not the virus.
1/0/1	The vaccine is the only solution. I"m going to get the vaccine. I take care of my health because I am person of risk. I am optimist.
1/1	The vaccine is the solution!
0/0	The vaccine isn‚Äôt reliable! I know someone who had her first dose of the vaccine and then caught covid.
0/1	The vaccine manufacturers have immunity from all lawsuits. I'll wait.
0/0	The vaccine might effect newborns!!! I'll take that back if they have proof it wont do that
1/-1	The vaccine reduced my age by about 10 years. Greatest thing to ever happen to me.
1/-1	The vaccine should be made available for anyone that wants it, but should never be forced on anyone.
0/-1	The vaccine should be tested on politicians first. If they survive, THE VACCINE IS SAFE. If they don't, then THE COUNTRY IS SAFE
0	The vaccine should be tested on politicians first. If they survive, THE VACCINE IS SAFE. If they don't, then THE COUNTRY IS SAFE" by Polish Author.
1/1	The vaccine should work, so we can go back to normal lifes
1/1	The vaccine sounds so exciting, can't wait to take it.
0/-1	The vaccine studies are rushed, all a shot in the dark, one can‚Äôt just assume they bring a net benefit.
0/-1	The vaccine type matters to me!
0/0	The vaccine was never necessary because 99.997% of people survive Covid
0/0	The vaccine was never necessary because 99.997% of people survive Covid and when someone survives it, that person becomes immune and will not be capable of passing it onto people. And when enough people have gotten it, herd immunity takes effect and Covid goes extinct. By slowing the spread of Covid which is a relatively harmless virus, you are giving it chances to mutate and therefore inhibiting herd immunity.
1/1	The vaccine was not rushed, it was expedited. All steps were done. Animal trials, phase 1, 2, and 3. The same amount of hours went into research but more people were doing it. This was made a priority. Get the vaccine. You're healthy, you will be just fine.
0/0	The vaccine will learn your body to destroy itself, good luck with your happy shot.
0/0	The vaccine will poison everyone!!
1/-1	The vaccine will work but the question is that will it also work on people who already caught this virus
1/1	The vaccine's bound to have side effects, even the flu jab has side effects! Put it this way, have the jab and life will soon return to a sense of normalcy, don‚Äôt have the jab and stay locked in your house and never have a social life again
0/0	The vaccines a load of bollocks. Usually take decades got this in a year.Unless they had it all along but what is it really for ?
0/0	The vaccines are a way to eliminate the human race in great numbers and then blame everything on the Pandemic
0/0	The vaccines are all fake, except the Madagascan one! So, I don't need any of them for my children and myself, keep them off us. Never force us for that will cost you so dearly.
1/1	The vaccines are as safe as they can get
1/1	The vaccines are life savers. I'm looking forward to my second dose.
1/1	The vaccines are still worth getting, even if they are slightly less effective against the three new coronavirus strains coming out of the UK, South Africa and Brazil. My expectation is that there will be a third booster shot for the coronavirus vaccine coming up a few months from now, which will be recommended to get as well. Meantime, maintain vigilance: continue to social distance, wear a mask & don't touch your face while outside, wash hands first thing coming inside
0/0	The vaccines aren't safe at all
0/0	The vaccines aren‚Äôt safe at all
1/1	The vaccines cannot cause covid because they aint the virus
0/0	The vaccines could also be leaving people more susceptible to the virus, over-sensitizing them to it.
1/1	The vaccines is greatly in need especially to the hard hit Africa, our continent dependence on west economically show s our stand.
1	The vaccines likely reduce contagion
1/1	The vaccines made it through Phase 3 trials... I'll take it! I don't want this virus. Period.
1/1	The vaccines offer one of the ways we may be able to end the pandemic
1/1	The vaccines passed several types of testing and it is safe. This vaccine is not rushed because in the USA we have more critical levels to pass to prove it is safe than other countries do. Pfizer has an outstanding reputation.
0/0	The vaccines we are inundated with will be like sweeties except they might kill you !
0/0	The vaccines will kill us all. Europe, UK, elderly and younger.
1/1	The vaccine‚Äô doesn‚Äôt prevent you getting Covid, it helps reduce the symptoms and side effects that put the most vulnerable into hospital, taking the pressure off the NHS, but like the UK üá¨üáß people they don‚Äôt think üëç like that, just about themselves
1/1	The vaccine‚Äôs effectiveness at preventing severe disease, even with the new variants circulating ‚Äî and with a single shot per person ‚Äî is particularly impressive! Congratulations
1/1	The vacine production needs to increase, its a race againt the clock..Is the Moderna and Pfizer vaccine really less efective against African variant?
1/1	The vast majority of vaccine skeptics aren‚Äôt willing to give up their jobs, social life, and ability to exist in public over their ‚Äúbeliefs‚Äù.
0/0	The very fact it's being pushed worldwide in a rapid pace, while not needed. Should make you question and not take it

0/0	The virus isn't deadly enough, let's make a deadlier vaccine.
0/0	The virus that is contagious and killing us is money virus
0/0	The way they describe the mRNA it literally is the virus. Does the exact same thing as a virus how they explain it. Covid don't exist. The vax is the virus
1/1	The weapon to end the war...
0/0	The whole year this covid 19....84 has been around. I have yet to see any sign of it. I don't need a questionable vaccine,to deliver me from a non threatening illness. Do you trust your own judgement. Or trust Gates, the W H O, U N, dodgy politico's with ties to big pharma, propaganda media, which first scare you into thinking there's a threat, then scare you into taking the cure to their threat. On this subject there are two kinds of people. Those who think for themselves. And those who outsource their thinking to government.

1/1	Then I'll get one. To protect people like you.
1/1	Then bring it on! I'll be first in line when it's ready and I fall into the at risk group. I wonder how many people have had the shingles vaccine? The first shot was a breeze, but the second shot made me sick as a dog.Still, I'm willing to put up with some discomfort to be free of fear of catching Covid.
0/0	Then just inject water or bathe in garlic, just as effective by this logic.
1/1	Then make the vaccinations more readily available.
0/0	Then tell me why my child was normal until his MMR vaccine? The government loves ppl like you. Blinded by the truth and easy to manipulate
1/0	Then there is the theory that covid-19 vaccination will be a ploy to microchip people as we do pets.
0/0	Then they start eating people
0/0	Then why did you get vaccinated dumbass
1/0	Then you must forgo treatment whe gasping for air if you contract corona as you know better
1/1	There HAVE been mRNA vaccines before, specifically the one for Ebola - which I believe was in stage 3 trials and got an emergency use authorization.
1/1	There are 1.1 billion anti-vaxers according to plague inc, so if that is true, it proves human stupidity.
0/0	There are 4 kinds of vaccines. 1. Poison 2. Poison 3. Poison 4. Poison
1/1	There are a lot friends in my circle who are just skeptical about the efficacy and safety of the vaccine (understandably so; they are not anti vaxers). I‚Äôm willing to take the minute it is available so that I can live a normal life soon and hopefully trigger others in my circle to follow suit. However I‚Äôd prefer to see more data by the time my time comes. Not vaccinated while the world opens up around you will be ten times more scarier to me because of increased chances of getting it due to mobility
1/1	There are at least ten vaccines that are in various stages of trials, these are just the three that are the furthest along. We'll need as many as we can get.
0/0	There are claims that vaccination was rushed, or that ‚Äúcorners were cut‚Äù in the clinical trials or the government‚Äôs safety review and approval process.
1/1	There are many heroes emerging during this pandemic. These guys, arguably, are at the top of the heap!
1/1	There are millions of people to vaccinate and the NHS are doing more than their best . We will have it done but don‚Äôt put them under more pressure than they are already.
0/0	There are natural ways to boost our immunity & safeguard our health rather than taking a vaccine!
1/0	There are no anti vaxxer vids on YT that explain why they are of the opinion they are...
0/0	There are no side effects to any drug, it's the effect of the drug. If you don't take it you will not be affected, whatever happens to you when you take it is not a side effect it's a direct effect. Stop playing with words!

1/1	There are risks with everything. We all take chances in life.
1/1	There are some realy smart people at work
0/0	There are studies showing that the vaccine actually makes them susceptible to a much severe respiratory coronavirus issue in the future
0/0	There are the side effects. Anaphylaxis‚Äîor a severe allergic reaction‚Äîis possible
1/1	There are two bad things to weigh against each other, so you choose what you think is least bad. One of the scales is the risk of side effects or other shit with taking the vaccine. In the other scale lies the risk of becoming ill and perhaps losing smell and taste forever (is life worth living then?) And the risk of spreading the infection to others who are unvaccinated. I will get vaccinated!
0/0/0	There has never been a vaccine for corona virus . And you can NOT see into the future to know what effect or damage this vaccine might do.
0/-1	There has never been a vaccine to any of the other coronaviruses, and this supposed new one...less than a year with no proper testing.....done.....come on folks
1/1	There have been a lot of studies that requiring vaccines for school does actually improve vaccination numbers because homeschooling is a lot of work.
0/0	There have been cases of facial paralysis here in the UK because of vaccination
0/0	There have been cases of facial paralysis here in the UK.
0/0	There have been countless deaths from the vaccine that are underreported by the media.
0/0	There have been deaths concerning the covid vaccine... have you not seen it in the news‚Ä¶
0/0	There have been many great documentaries showing vaccine injury. But NOTHING has ever shown vaccine-free families.
0/0	There have been several cases of anaphylaxis, or severe allergic reaction, among people with a history of such reactions who received the COVID-19 vaccine.
1/1	There haven't been any weird side-effects or problems for my mother. She has diabetes and got her second dose recently.
0/0	There is NOTHING wrong with not wanting to get vaccinated. People should not be forced to put a MAN MADE chemical into their body to pacify someone else.
1/1	There is a big misunderstanding about this second dose and this 3 week time period . The three week time period is mainly a time period used specifically for the vaccine trials and thus the time frame officially recommended. It is not a time scale of vaccine effectiveness . And it has been discussed a longer time may be even advantageous. Its also looking like with new mutations , we will all need constant rolling vaccines every 4 to 6 months probably to keep up so uk has actually got it spot I believe. Israel is one big test research for Pfizer that gives Israel special perks for the exclusivity so some research from Israel should be taken with a commercial bias perhaps , but its all good that Israel and Pfizer are doing with their vaccine program
1/-1	There is a lag Between getting #Covid19vaccination & Protection. Vaccine protects most, but not all infection. Vaccines don‚Äôt work Retroactively. Certain Variants could be less Susceptible to vaccines. Vaccines prevent disease but not all infection.
1/1	There is a lot of misinformation about vaccines out there, so here is some basic science on how they have work.
1/1	There is a lot of misinformation around vaccines. While vaccines are risky, the benefits outweigh the risks.
0/0	There is a no liability clause on all vaccinations since 1983. That fact alone should make you not want to take it.
0/0	There is a risk
0/0	There is absolutely no need for vaccines to extinguish the pandemic. I've never heard so much nonsense talked about vaccines
1/1	There is allways those idiots that truly believe vaccines to be dangerous and refuse to take them.
0/0	There is far too much money on the line with the useless and pointless Covid-19 vaccine for it to ever be pulled. It could cause people to grow three heads and the authorities would still let it be rolled out
1/1	There is light at the end of the tunnel by taking the vaccine
0/0	There is live covid 19 virus in the vaccine. Does it make any sense to inject it into your body?
0/0	There is no data if the vaccin works(!), and if stops the virus from spreading. These are facts. Then what's the use of this vaccine which is created in a year? Ask yourself why. We don't have knowledge what mRNA will do in the long run. How can it be then, that this vaccin is being enrolled on such a large scale? Ask yourself why. The ancient tactic divide and conquer is proving to be effective once again. The collective subconciousness has taken over and the world is in a mass regression. What is coming to my mind right now, is a video I once watched of a former KGB agent. He was smiling and saying, it takes a while to brainwash people, maybe 10/20 years but it's effective. Even if you shove the facts under their nose (literally), they will not believe it. I researched many hours and gathered these facts from different sources and scientific reports. You should do the same.
0/-1	There is no debate over safety if long term studies have not been done. You can't call it safe, in fact its hugely irresponsible and liable claims should be filed against those who say its safe without any long term effects data available. If its safe then allow Phizer etc to be sued over any future adverse effects.
1/1	There is no evidence that the risks of vaccination outweighs the benefits of getting vaccinated. Oh also, Facebook posts and instagram doesn't count as research or evidence.
0/0	There is no long term research to back up their claims. So good luck!
1/1	There is no other way that to get vaccined.. Don‚Äôt behave with stupidity!!
0/0	There is no point by the end of 2020 we'll probably all be dead anyway √∞≈∏Àú‚Äö
0/0	There is no proof that ordering from your favorite restaurant tonight while watching your favorite show is an effective COVID vaccine but there is also no proof that it is NOT an effective vaccine. So I say let it rip, friends.
0/-1	There is no proof the vaccine will stop you from getting the virus or from spreading it. It just minimizes the symptoms.
1/1	There is no threat. We are not taking part in a trial or experimentation. The vaccines have been approved through use by experts, parts of the vaccine (non-specific to covid) have been in development and testing for years. You can refuse the vaccine. I suggest you read up.
0	There is no virus..coronavirus is the common cold..the vaccine will change your DNA forever.
0/0	There is no way I'm taking this
0/0	There is no way Im getting these vaccines.
0/0/0/0/0	There is no way I‚Äôm taking a vaccine right away. I‚Äôm waiting at least a year to see what happens to y‚Äôall.
0/-1	There is no way im taking the shot.
0/-1	There is no way of knowing at this point how these vaccines will affect each person. It takes a long time to develop a vaccine. This warp speed vaccine was not tested long enough. They don't know the actual short, or long term side effects. Or, if it will potentially cause permanent damage, or death because there's no way of knowing at this time.
1/1	There is overwhelming scientific evidence that vaccination is the best defence against serious infections.
1/1	There is so much misinformation being spread about the disease and the vaccine, and you have made it very simple for people to understand. I hope this helps to dispel some of the fear people have of this vaccine.
1/0	There is such an absurd amount of misinformation in this content section. Just goes to show you that it's only "trust the scientists" when they back up your preconceived arguments.
0/0	There isn't any knowledge or data of the side affects because it hasn't been tested. She is contradicting herself.
1/0	There isn't any knowledge or data of the side affects because it hasn't been tested. Vaccination is fine.
0/0	There will NEVER be a cure..
0/0	There will NEVER be a cure...
0/0	There will be an enormous cover up over these reactions to this dangerous vaccine
1/1	There's a lot of great news lately, despite the variants - all vaccines seem to protect against severe disease from all current variants. It seems like post-vaccination life will be very close to normal, and Covid will actually be like a mild flu then
1/-1	There's an art to explaining complex issues in an easy-to-understand manner.
0/0	There's certainly a search for a safe effective vaccine but worries that companies or governments might push through something that isn't ready or properly tested is certainly a fair one to have, especially once you consider that Reddit is a global website and not every country and culture has a good history with being able to trust their doctors.
0/0	There's many reasons NOT to take any vaccine ESPECIALLY this one
1/1/1/-1	There's no "Pro-vaccine" There's just "Anti-vaccine" and normal people
0/0	There's no conspiracy theory here. Distrust is very very real.
1/0	There's no evidence the COVID-19 vaccine is unsafe if you're pregnant.
0/0	There's no pandemic
0/0	There's no such thing as a coincidence. Keep my vaccines.
1/0	There's side effect if you don't get it you won't be around
1/1	There's undue attention being paid to the effectiveness of each vaccine candidate. Seasonal flu vaccines are often less than 50% effective and are still considered a worthy use of NHS funds. Fact: any level of effectiveness will help to reduce the R number. Got that? Now, let's stop fussing about a few percentage points, and the horrible prospect of idiots demanding different types of vaccines.
1	There's yet to be any scientifically sound evidence to prove otherwise (that vaccines aren't safe and effective)
0/0	Theres a lot of excitement around the new record vaccines???? Is there really? Maybe for the stupidly brainwashed
0/0	There‚Äôs a lot bots commenting on this video how they got the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer vaccine.Don‚Äôt fall for the trap!
0/0	There‚Äôs a plethora of bad side effects caused by this vaccine that are worse than the virus it was created to protect people from.
0/0	There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm taking this shit
1/1	There‚Äôs no win win only loose loose till we can get enough vaccine into arms
1/0	There‚Äôs not enough vaccines right now, if there projection of when there will be- it‚Äôs to late.
0/-1	These 2 don't even know they re being used
0/0	These Doctors won‚Äôt even take it!!!
1/1	These antivaxxers could be guilty of culpable homicide. Governments should pass emergency legislation to prevent these radicals from having a platform to spread their dangerous views
1/1	These are all coincidences. Vaccines don't cause death I think you're getting mixed up, it's anti Vax people that cause death. If someone can't get the vax for some reason, and then 6 other ppl in their class CHOOSE not too then it's not only putting your child at risk, it's also putting all the children who physically CAN'T have the vax in danger. You put your siblings, friends and everyone who can't have it done in danger. It keeps getting passed on and turns into an epidemic.
0/-1	These doctors are eugenicists. Psycopaths.
0/1	These doctors should be applauded for standing up for the people!!!! The title should be "doctors for early treatment ".
0	These guys were strong and manly before they had their experimental mRNA shots.
0/0	These include the claim that the genetic material in the vaccine will find its way into your DNA permanently.
1/1	These new types of medicines, they are the future. mRNA / siRNA / DNA medicines will help us one day develop medicines to kill cancer cells safely and kill bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics. The COVID19 virus was a blessing in disguise in that it triggered governments to get off their butts and remove a bunch of red tape and bs out of the way. It allowed researchers around the world to go into hyper drive essentially and develop this as quickly and safely as possible. A crap load of data has been generated and much more will come. We will probably save several years of research time on these types of medicines after all is said and done. I honestly think that ethics boards should go fly a kite. If someone wants to volunteer their life to the betterment of society and is of sound mind, then let them. It's our bodies. Tired of people constantly feeling like they get to dictate how everyone else should live because they "feel" a certain way.
1/1	These people are freaking out over a 1 in 1000000000 chance of getting a bad reaction to a vaccine but completely overlook the harmful effects of their lifestyle
0/-1	These ppl should change there name to daily dose of vaccine
0/1/1	These scientists who developed the vaccine are speedrunners
1/-1	These side effects are known and are a sign that your immune system is working.
0/0	These two guys are idiots or obviously paid by big pharma or are too scared to say the truth in case they get censored and banned. Anyway there is the answer about the vaccines safety. NOT SAFE VERY DANGEROUS!!!!!!!!!!
0/0	These two men, I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t believe not one word they tell us. These two men are way to scripted, way to excited and way to happy about the vaccines.
0/0	These vaccinations need to be stopped right now.
0/0	These vaccine's usually have bad reactions even when done patiently. This is rushed and I'm not a guinea pig.
1/1	These vaccines are awesome.
1/1	These vaccines are based on previous SARS virus work, so strictly speaking they have been in development for 17 years.
1/1	These vaccines are entirely safe and hey are effective, your family doctor will assure you of that .
1/1	These vaccines are entirely safe and hey are effective, your family doctor will assure you of that . There are sad anti vaxxers posting here some pretending to be medically qualified but pay them no heed,
0/0	These vaccines are going to damage your RNA, turn your body in a GMO and may result in eventual organ failure!!
0/0	These vaccines are not proven to be ‚Äòsafe and effective‚Äô. There is no way of knowing long-term side effects, though having looked into it, I would think these would include some sort of immunodeficiency disorder as well as infertility. Not surprising, since the main orchestrators wish to drastically reduce the world‚Äôs population.
0/0	These vaccines are not safe !!! To develop a safe vaccine, it takes many years .... not a year. Another thing is even Those companies like Pfizer not taking any responsibility for any side effects as they even can‚Äôt say what they are especially long-term side effects !!! In Europe is already many deaths and side effects after that of course it‚Äôs not after the vaccine they reckon !!!!! Stop this propaganda
1/1	These vaccines are very well tolerated from the data we've seen
0/0	These vaccines do not have an excellent track record. They are new so there is no data. Further they are a type of vaccine that has never been used before
0/0	These vaccines have never been tested long enough to determine if they'll cause ADE or not
0/0	These vaccines may be modifying the genetic make up of the virus into new strains , instead of creating an actual immunity
0/0	These vaccines will sterilize the person who receives it. That means you can't have any children. This is how the New World Order will meet the United Nations 2030 agenda to reduce the population. If this is what you want...then get the so called vaccine.
0/-1	These videos on the various vaccines aren't critical enough. And the conclusions are based on studies in the short term small sample sizes.
0/0	They Have NOT CURED The COMMON COLD VIRUS, NOR CURED The AIDS VIRUS, Why Should We Be DECEIVED TO Believe They Can Cure The COVID-19 Virus???
1/1	They are RIGHT! Healthcare workers over the WHOLE WORLD should have top priority.
0/0	They are all under trial for 2 years yet so I‚Äôll wait thanks. They have absolutely no clue how the vaccines work with so many conditions and other medications. They still don‚Äôt even have enough data to declare they are 100% safe re human fertility! Covid is no threat to most
1/1	They are clearly trying to skew data to emphasize their points. If the US has rolled out more vaccines than any other country than what does percent vaccinated to population matter?! Israel‚Äôs population is 1/36th our population, of course they‚Äôd have a higher percent vaccinated. Why have more white Americans received the vaccine? Because the first wave was directed towards healthcare workers, teachers, and law enforcement. The majority of people in those career fields are white, which explains why they would have higher vaccination numbers at this point in time. This is propaganda, plain and simple
0/0	They are dying because of the vaccine
1/1	They are incredibly safe, so there's on absolute safety in anything in life.
0/0	They are literally gonna kill off half the population and shrug it off with this corona virus vaccine
1/0	They are lying ...and after. Trump and dr fauci i dont trust them none of these fools
0/0	They are lying us
0/1	They are making up something special for us...all the darker people. It's their plan to give it to us first.... the vaccine.
0/0/0/0/0	They are not FDA approved!!! Not getting anything that is not FDA APPROVED!!!
0/-1	They are not responsible if something goes wrong with this experiment. Hell no. Give it to the elites. Don't hire someone and with technology make it appear as if they're taking it. No lawsuit no monkey suit
0/0	They are not safe for anyone. These are experimental mRNA vaccines that have already killed or maimed large numbers of people around the world. If you take these vaccines, you are serving as a laboratory rat for pharmaceutical companies that are making $$$Billions and face absolutely no liability for adverse reactions, including death.Furthermore, these vaccines are not necessary, since there are old (off-patent and therefore cheap), safe and effective medications like Hydroxychloroquine+zinc+azithromycin or Ivermectin.Do your research before you get these dangerous experimental vaccines, which, among other things, may cause infertility.
0/0	They are safe for no one.
0/0	They are trying to kill us, don't take the vaccine!
0/0	They are volunteering for vaccines for getting off loans... We know where we failed
0/0	They aren't safe yet for anyone. Criminally negligent at best you lot.
0/0/0/0/0/0	They aren't telling you about all the deaths caused by this vacs
0/0	They came out with 4 types of vaccines like they dropped a new clothing line or something. Lol
0/0	They can find a cure for covid within a year but can‚Äôt find a cure for cancer(s) .. I think I‚Äôll pass.
0/0	They can go to hell with their vaccine and I will NEVER EVER take it.
0/0/0	They can have mine, I won‚Äôt take that.
0/-1	They can have mine. I am a Senior an don't plan to use one.
0/0	They can have my dose. I don‚Äôt want that crap.
0/0	They can keep that garbage vaccine, I am not taking it at all period!!
0/0	They can now see into the future and know the long term effects. Amazing!
0/0	They can program that mRNA vaccine to do all kind of shit in our bodies beside killing the covid virus.
0/0	They can stick their experimental vaccines in their own arms.
0/0	They can stick their needle where the sun doesn‚Äôt shine. I am not taking the VACCINE
0/0	They can take that vaccine n put it up their?? I refuse, I will not take it.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	They can take that vaccine n put it up their?? I refuse, I will not take it..
1/1	They can't blame vaccines on their kid's autism. It's a genetic disorder. A vaccine is literally a weakened form of the virus suspended in liquid to create memory cells in your immune system. The sickness in your kid is the body's natural response. If you could please your last two brain cells, and see actual Doctor, and maybe educate yourselves. Because now we got measles coming back, and I guarantee you guys aren't helping AT ALL
0/0	They cannot force you to have anything because that is against your human rights, they can highly advise you to have it or try & black mail you into having it but they cannot force it upon you
0/0	They can‚Äôt make a cure to AIDS or herpes ext. yet they create a COVID vaccine less then a year!! Yea Righhhtt.
0/0	They can‚Äôt possibly know the long term side effects are there hasn‚Äôt been enough time or study on the vaccine or the possible reactions to other meds or diseases .
1/1	They caught it before the vaccine took effect. You need the booster shot 3 weeks later before it works. You can‚Äôt catch corona virus from the vaccine. Vaccine only has mRNA, not the virus.
1/1	They complain about wearing masks, their rights are being taken away, however they will not do the right thing to get back to normalcy! Hopefully the majority of us do the right thing and get the vaccine! We have to in order to get back to normalcy!
1/1	They could create ads informing people to get vaccinated.
0/0	They could if they wanted to, they have a license to kill with this vaccine.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	They couldn‚Äôt pay me to take this poison.
1/1	They develop a new flu vaccine yearly. This isn't developing a vaccine from the ground up, we know how to do it now. It's like saying you wouldn't fly on a new jet because it took the Write brothers 6 years to figure out flight.
0/1	They don't chase these ppl down to give them food or water. Only vaccines.
0/0	They don't work. Merck (one of the vaccine manufacturers) has said it's better to get the virus and recover from it than to take the vaccine.
1/1	They don‚Äôt talk about the huge distribution problem of mRNA vaccine. That vaccine needs -70C freezer for storage. On the other hand, astrazeneca only needs 4C and is way more cheeper to produce.
1/1	They got infected from someone not the vaccine. The first vaccine only introduces the virus to the body and allows the body to fight it off. That‚Äôs when the body attacks the virus. 21 days after, you get the second vaccine and that will decrease the chance of contracting the virus by 95%.
0/0/0/0	They have been working on coronavirus vaccines for years. They have never been successful. Suddenly successful?
0/-1	They have compromised themselves when they hid the truth of this pandemic from us.
0/-1	They have doubts as to whether the vaccines are actually safe, given the rapid pace of development, and whether possible side effects have been adequately studied.
0/0	They have not followed the same testing guidelines as a FDA approved vaccine. As a matter a fact animal studies were skipped in many of these ‚Äútrials‚Äù.
0/0	They have not had enough time for trials. Count me out
0/0	They have to catch me first !!
0/0	They haven't been tested on animals human beings are the Guinea pigs. This is all lies no one trust who anymore.
0/0	They inject you future mutations..let us see where that leads to the ones that took it
0/0	They is some hidden agenda on this demonic virus, why explain the way they make these vaccines, it's about time we run to Jesus and repent our si a brothers and sisters
0/-1	They just getting flu shots
0/0	They just had a person died this week from that vaccines. It was just on the news this week
0/-1	They just want to put chips in you
0/-1	They like to tell us the reason for something is one thing when it really exists for a totally different reason. Like they say abortion gives women a choice but it‚Äôs really depopulation
0/0	They love the "Anti Vaxxer" tag. If someone doesn't want to take vaccines based on knowledge they have required then what's the problem? Surely it's about being pro safe, and the fact is this vaccine has not been proven to be safe. I've had many vaccines but I will not be having this one.
0/0	They lying dont take it
0/0	They managed to survive Covid, but not the vaccine. R.I.P.
0/0	They might as well just line people up and literally pull the trigger. This is flat out murder without the bullets but yet instead in a liquid form.
1/0	They need to widely promote and show the results of all tests and studies of the vaccine. Like spend hours on tv and social media showing it. If it‚Äôs positive people may change their minds
0/0	They never isolated the alleged first strain. Why should we believe there is a new strain? Viruses don't exist. The "vaccine" is a bioweapon in disguise. Wake up!
1/-1	They recently announced that they're looking at using the same technology to treat MS with a vaccine. What a time to be alive.
0/0	They say the corona virus will kill you if you are old and have underlying conditions. That you are to stay inside and wear a mask when you do go out. Then they develop a vaccine in record time which basically gives you the corona virus to stimulate anti bodies. In conclusion they are killing you with a vaccine.
0/0	They should be hesitant. Everyone should be
1/1	They should not be called anti vaxxers They are pro-disease
0/0	They testing the vaccine on the sick and elderly, if they die it‚Äôll be considered just another covid death
0/0	They think their only solution is a vaccine and they get paranoid if they don‚Äôt have a vaccine for every virus and infectious desease.
0/0	They told us lead paint , tephlon frying pans, thalidomide, mercury fillings and a million other things were safe too.
0/0	They want depopulation to start as soon as possible.
0/0	They want us to change into zombies
0/0	They want you to have the vaccine because it has a tracing cell in it which they want everyone to have.
0/0/0	They will be blaming the virus for people dying from the vaccine
0/0	They will be exempt from liability.. do not get that vaccine
0/0	They will never admit it was their vaccine. They have millions of doses they want to inject into us. Besides, the underlying reason for this vaccine is not for the bogus COVID, but for population control.
1	They will survive it I had mine no side effects at alk
0/0	They won't tell you how many have died or had bad side effects from the vax will they?
1/1	They work
0/1	They'll have to give it to me kicking and screaming
0/0	They're all pseudoscience pushing eugenics
0/1	They're determined to stick that devil's brew in to us all, may the gods protect us all üëç
0/0	They're never jabbing that stuff in my arm ... it isn't a cure anyway
0/0	Theyre doing it on tv so the sheep will say i saw mr. so and so do it live on tv! They couldnt fake it! Its safe! We wouldnt fake injecting the real poison into our bodies. Shame on all of them. Both sides of the bird. What a let down these self appointed leaders are. Just cuz you enter a ballot doesnt mean it gets counted fairly. Rothschild said give me control over a nations currency and i care not who is in charge. 100% rigged illusion of choice.
0/0	They‚Äòre not coming near me with that vaccine! We should have a choice.
0/0	They‚Äôll probably be reluctant to take a vaccine which has been created in a year when it normally takes decades to make sure they are safe and if you aren‚Äôt worried about the safety of it then that‚Äôs odd
0/0	They‚Äôre all psychopaths working for #BillGates the biggest psychopath of them all. Don‚Äôt say vaccine to save lives, say vaccine for profits & control. Speak the truth!
0/0	They‚Äôre just advertising free slow killing lethal injection
0/0	They‚Äôre made in India with dirty water no thanks
1	Things are clicking! 1. A vaccine that works ‚úì 2. A monoclonal antibody EUA ‚úì 3. A coronavirus task force ‚úì 4. Leadership that believes in and is guided by science ‚úì
0/0	Things come apart so easily when they have been held together by lies
1/-1	Things keep ramping up. More than 10% of the population has been given their first shots in Biden's first two weeks. I'm going to Europe in the summer, baby! It's almost over!
0/0	Think about it, a company created 10 years ago...has never had anything approved ever is pushing a vaccine for a pandemic. If that doesn‚Äôt set off the fire alarm I don‚Äôt know what else could
0/0	This ""vaccine"" is nothing short of a big ugly joke
1/1	This COVID-19 is no joke. Please take maximum possible precautions which include wearing masks, personal hygiene, physical distancing, keeping indoors as much as possible, and taking the available vaccine when possible.
0/-1	This Vaccine matter has been more a Commercial/Political activity than subject matter medical research !
1/1	This all seems very promising and hopefully we really can be back to normal by Spring.
1/1	This bridge is only 99% safe so we should just swim in the shark infested water
1/1	This cannot be understated - these #CovidVaccines prevent severe disease, hospitalizations, and ICU admissions, reducing #COVID19 to a manageable illness while preserving healthcare capacity and function.
0/0	This citizen of rural area DOES NOT want the experimental drug
1/-1	This comment field makes me sick. I sure hope the real world has a more sober view on science‚Ä¶
1/-1	This comment section is proof that our education systems have failed.
0/0	This commercial has been brought to you by Pharma Inc.
0/0	This company willingly poisoned us. I‚Äôll never take this
0/0	This confirmed my decision I made a while ago...I'm not taking !
1/1	This convinced me to take the vaccine.
1/1	This coronavirus vaccine news is tremendous! An effective and safe vaccine would save thousands of lives and give us a path back to normalcy. Go science!!
0/1	This covid will never end. My arm still hurt from the Pfizer vaccine
0/0	This dude is a gate keeper ! a mouthpiece for big pharma !
0/-1	This entire covit19 was to FORCE FLU VACCCINATE every human being on the planet as to get HERD IMMUNITY AGAINST A HEALTY LIFE
0/0	This entire pandemic was just to VACCINATE ALL OF HUMANITY for population control
0/0	This guy is a shill, only Jesus can save us NOT a vaccine.
0/0	This guy should be in jail the vaccine is killing people.
0/-1	This has been rushed. It seems as though its been a race to get the rollout done as quick as possible, as if its a competition. No thank you‚Ä¶
0/0	This has done absolutely nothing to persuade me to get this jab.
0/-1	This has not been engineered to stop by vaccine!
0/0	This hoax vaccine is simply a step towards population control. Wait a couple years and we'll really see the results...smdh...
0/0	This is 1000% political bullshit. First they said it was 100% effective, and now that there are more virus variants, we suddenly have vaccine variants that were never announced?
0/0	This is a RNA editing vaccine. That is an issue. I refuse it.
1/1	This is a clearly expressed and informative video about the process of ensuring that vaccines are safe. Reassuring to learn of the steps being taken. It does not seek to address the tiny number of adverse events that have occurred - and rightly so. That's for another video. Thank you WHO for working so hard - and I appreciate it's cumulative work built up over decades, not just a knee-jerk reaction to this particular pandemic.
0/0	This is a disgrace' promoting something that is not even a vaccine and is not tested and possibly not safe....... aghhhhhh
1/1	This is a good thing.
1/-1	This is a huge step for bioprocessing as a whole
0/0	This is a lie. This is the mark of the beast. Wake up people.
0/0	This is a mass experiment that should have been in a laboratory with animals & NOT ON PEOPLE
1/-1	This is a multifactorial issue. It's not just one thing, and making it sound like it is does not help with vaccine confidence
0/1	This is a plain and simple lie. 23 people in Norway died after the vaccine. Not from adverse reactions. They vaccinated the very elderly and some of them died. No evidence of death linked to the vaccine. Stop spreading dangerous disinformation.
1/0	This is a proper vaccine. Vaccines take a long time to develop for a lot of reasons, it doesn‚Äôt mean this one was rushed because it was done quickly.
0/0	This is absolute lies. Friend of my got vaccines and got pretty sick. I do not believe in immunization. There is definitely side affect
1/1	This is actually a valid question. So a vaccine doesn‚Äôt completely prevent a virus from infecting your body, but it helps your body develop what is called antibodies. And antibodies are created so that if that same virus were to infect you again, your body would have immunity built up against that virus, making you not fall as ill.
1/1	This is all generally as predicted. Like with the flu jab, they‚Äôll be a new one released each year, except we will want a much higher percentage of the population to get it than the flu jab. If having a needle jabbed in my arm twice a year is the price for no more lockdowns, then I‚Äôm more than willing.
1/1/1	This is amazing! I had always thought they used the same traditional process!
0/-1	This is an EXPERIMENTAL vacine that has not been tested on animals 1st and you can still catch it and pass it on after taking the vacine,so you are the Guinea pigs wow
0/0	This is an advertisement!!!!!!
1/1	This is an amazing moment in history, a huge thank you to the scientists that made this possible! It's unbelievable that a virus that no one knew existed 12 months ago now not only has a vaccine, but a vaccine that is over 90% effective.
0/0	This is an experimental, untested gene therapy not a vaccine. Potentially reduces symptoms, has major side effects, doesn't stop you from getting sick, doesn't stop transmission, still have to wear a mask? For a condition with only 0.4% of "positive" cases being serious?!?
0/0	This is awful lot like the "educational video" in Jurassic Park explaining how dinosaurs are made...right before they start killing people.
1/1	This is big news. This vaccine, unlike the ones from Moderna and Pfizer we actually have a shot at producing locally. I'd be interested to know if that big order from the government comes with a contract production rider
0/0	This is bullshit! The vaccine is there to kill us all
0/0	This is criminal human experimentation and genocide.
0/0	This is criminal human experimentation and genocide. Covid 1984 will Never be forgotten in history! Mark my words
0/-1	This is embarrassing, Germany comes out with the vaccine and oh sorry we did not order enough, by the way, screw parents we need to open schools?
0/0	This is exactly the reason I won't get the vaccine. Were the pharmaceutical companies just hoping to withhold it if president trump was re elected?
1/1	This is exactly why this is so exciting... I keep telling everyone I know to go read up on why this new medical tech is so awesome. It's going to change the world and help develop treatments and cures for other fatal diseases
1/1	This is fabulous news, at last a cheap and very easily transportable vaccine, well done Oxford University, you will go down in history
1/1	This is fabulous news, at last a cheap and very easily transportable vaccine, well done Oxford University, you will go down in history üá¨üáß
1/1	This is fabulous. Not being dependent on other countries for our supplies of anything is a game changer. This had been done last year. But it will be done NOW. Fantastic !!!
1/1	This is first time that I will not be scared of getting corona vaccine injection
1/1	This is good news to the world. Kudos to those brilliant minds.
1/1	This is good news. The point isn't that the vaccine produces an immune response, that was known already, the point is that it also produces an immune response in older people, at least at a sufficiently high rate.
1/1	This is good to hear. Maybe after this we should preemptively look for other pandemic viruses and figure out vaccines for those before they start.
1/1	This is good, but this one is less effective than Moderna. I hope I don‚Äôt get stuck with the Johnson and Johnson vaccination.
1/-1	This is good.
1/1	This is great but the vaccine is not available for everyone as you know. My father is over 65 with a compromise immune system and he still waiting. In the meantime he still goes to work at one of the DC government agencies as he is required to be there.
1/1	This is great news and Hopefully this will be executed as soon as possible and quickly distributed to all ... so everyone will have some chance of normality back in their lives in the new year . Hopefully this will enable companies, shops, tourism, leisure , hospitality sectors, schools, etc ....and all our economy to get saved and slowly get back to normal. Plus our hospitals have a chance to breathe as they all have worked soo incredibly hard ...... over the past year with this awful Pandemic ...
1/1	This is great news that vaccines will be out soon! Pharmaceutical innovations can be believed. Can‚Äôt wait to get one
1/1	This is great news. Of the 75,000 people who received the vaccine in a controlled study, NOT ONE PERSON has died of covid and very few have been hospitalized.

1/1	This is my mom getting her second vaccine today. Cheers to all our healthcare workers!!
1/-1	This is my winner here. I am getting this 1 dose from this‚Ä¶
0/0	This is natural selection in progres‚Ä¶ no vaccine
0/0	This is not a new vaccine, GTFO!
1/1	This is not a race between humans, it is a race against the Virus.I sincerely hope all the vaccine listed in here will help us beat the virus.
1/1	This is not a simple cold/flu virus. Even those that recover from it have debilitating residual chronic effects. You're far safer with the vaccine even if it didn't work at all. It is not just to save your life but to preserve your quality of life. One example is that people who have suffered CoViD has lost significant lung functionality. It is like they have been smokers their entire life. If you suffer from that it is like having COPD and oxygen tanks for life. If the vaccine protected you against just that alone it would be worth it. Yet there are other debilitating effects like blood clots whether in limbs, brain, or heart. You may survive without the vaccine, but who wants to be among those suffering from effects needlessly.
0/1	This is not a vaccine It‚Äôs a killing machine
0/0	This is not a vaccines!!! This is a mRNA gene therapy!! 55 and going died in US, 30 in Norway, 10 in Germany, 53 in Gibraltar, Portugal a healthy nurse, Brazil, not to mention significant side effects of cerebral palsy and convulsion!!!
1/1	This is not the time to be a baby about getting the shot. I got my first COVID shot this morning. My arm does not even hurt. I have seen people moan and fuss over a splinter. Get over it. This is new. I got that. Whatever the side effect is, it is small potatoes compared to what the COVID virus will do to you. You bet I rolled up my sleeve for this shot.
0/0	This is parroting, thats what they told you. No ones gotten their hand on the substance so no one knows exactly what it's programmed to do, so you can not be sure. This started with fears of a virus (alleged virus), then restrictions (decimation and total control). They told us, a vaccine would reverse all of this. It's not doing any of that. We know that for sure.
0/0	This is poison
0/0	This is propaganda for a vaccine that is neither needed, nor safe. I don't like it!
1/1	This is really fantastic news for all you that will be having it. Hope it brings you the security you need to start living your lives again.
0/0	This is repulsive. I will NOT be getting this toxic crap. I'm not an idiot
1/-1	This is ridiculous. To start with, the largest studies dispelling the MMR vaccine-autism "link" are not even American, but Scandinavian, so even if an American organisation fiddle with the data to "cover up" things, there are plenty of other studies that explore the potential link between MMR and autism and find there is none. The only one study that does find a link is the Wakefield study, with was retracted due to being fraudulent. Also, I'd like to gently remind everyone re. graphs that correlation does NOT equal causation. The apparent rise in autism is disputed too. There is a rise in autism DIAGNOSES, but then a lot of things that were previously diagnosed as retardation or childhood psychosis or (in the Asperger end of the autism spectrum) not diagnosed at all, is today diagnosed as autism spectrum disorders. Also, please just cut it and wake up from the Antivaxxer conspiracy. The impacts of not vaccinating children due to the fictive MMR-autism link cause serious harm in society, such as vulnerable people (babies, old, sick) suffering and dying from preventable diseases, and people with immune deficiencies having to avoid others and live in fear because they can no longer trust that they are protected by the general societal herd immunity, as it is slipping under the minimum required proportions for a number of severe, once eradicated diseases. The MMR-autism myth is great material for epic drama, but the drama (like this movie) is responsible for a lot of real life tragedies that can easily be avoided.
1/1	This is safest vaccine by miles, same principle as flu vaccine, other vaccines are first it's kind.
1/1	This is simply not true. It can be defeated with mass vaccination, contact tracing, and effective quarantines and testing. Multiple countries have proven the virus can be eliminated. Laziness is not an excuse.
1/1	This is so annoying. I had mine yesterday and yes aching and got the chills but the alternative is so much worse. Get the jab!
0/0	This is so bad. Moderna is a start up. They changed their name from ModeRNA. They don't have a single FDA approved medication. They have failed drug trials. They have never made a successful vaccine. ALSO! They are trying to invent a new mRNA vaccine that tricks, trains, triggers, your DNA. Never been done before. This is a company Bill Gates pushes. This is the conspiracy theories from Alex Jones coming true
1/1	This is so frustrating! All-day long today all I have heard is people declining the vaccine over stuff like this or 'Because my friend's son's wife's best friend posted on Facebook that vaccines are bad' It's ridiculous how unwilling people are to protect themselves and others.
0/0	This is so sad to read the comments on so many reports like this one. People look what the mainstream media and our government have done to our faith. I along with so many don't believe anything anymore. Sad days ahead for the world I believe.
1	This is such a massive milestone to develop a Covid vaccine so quickly. Science is awesome.
1/1	This is such great news; the JJ vaccine is a boon for poorer countries who haven't even received any vaccines yet. Disparities abound and I'm relieved many tens of millions of people should start getting this vaccine 'soon'.
1/1	This is the beginning of the END. Please get your COVID vaccine! How cool that the nurse with the needle is my RA patient
1/1	This is the best thing i heard all year

1/1	This is the only way to get rid of COVID
0/0	This is the serpent at work! Dont take it!
1/0	This is the unfortunate risk everyone has to take. Remember just a couple of months ago we were not even close to having one single vaccine. BTW vaccines are not created in such quick time. This is an emergency.
1/1	This is the vaccine I want. When will this be available?
1	This is the vaccine I‚Äôm hoping I can get ..
1/1	This is to a have some hope.
1/-1	This is transparently 'managing disappointment' amongst Germans. If the government could get hold of the AZ vaccine in quantities, they‚Äôed be saying it's brilliant and a must have. Because they can‚Äôt, they tell the masses, they're not missing much as it‚Äôs not very good. Macron‚Äôs doing the same in France‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..‚Ä¶..It‚Äôs how parent handle toddlers. It might work.

1/-1	This is very good news. I just saw it in the Spanish channel and is doing very well in Chile .
1/1	This is very informative video. Thank you the WHO for thorough explanation about safety of Covid-19 vaccines.
1/-1	This is was 5 months ago and not only are all the theories still around, they have gained traction.
1/1	This is what we need in the vaccines - a reduction in hospitalizations and deaths. If J&J can do it with one shot and at least extreme temperatures holdings this is great
1/1	This is what we need...factual information backed with science. Thank you, Doctor.
1/1	This is where I am a selfish bastard. I don‚Äôt care. When the vaccine is available, I will get it as soon as possible because I believe in the science behind it and believe the benefits greatly outweigh the risks.
0/0	This is why I don‚Äôt trust these medical professional they know better yet even they allow us to be exposed. Glad I‚Äôm not there and if the ones in my hospital do the same I won‚Äôt go to them.
0/0/0/0	This is why I will never take the covid-19 vaccine period.
1/0	This is wonderful news ‚Ä¶ what will the per dose inoculation cost each patient, and who is paying for it ?
1/1	This is wonderful news. A great step towards this crisis being sorted out. Still a ways to go, but I‚Äôll take a morale boost anywhere I can get it.
0/0	This is worse than McDonald's. People driving up and actually allowing someone to poke you with some clear fluid. Nah b I pass
0/0	This isn‚Äôt about a virus and it‚Äôs not about ‚Äúsaving lives‚Äù. That notion is laughable. This is about a major unprecedented push for control globally.
1/1	This isn‚Äôt even funny. Get the shot, trust the science.
1/0	This just proves how much technology has progressed. Vaccines usually take years to devolve and require live samples and now it can be produced with a genetic code on a computer screen.
0/0	This lady where my dad works died from the vaccine

0/0	This shit is all a joke, I‚Äôm not falling for any of it
1/1	This sounds brilliant, a much better approach compared to growing more of a deadly virus and injecting it in a weakened state into people like we currently do.
1/1	This statistics is not important. Accelerate vaccinations. Vaccinate all school children. Train more nurses to inject vaccine. Complete vaccine trials‚Ä¶
0/0	This thing is radically different from any other. It modifies DNA, it was rushed through by people that have no liability and have been repeatedly found to knowingly use noxious substances. And they want to force it! The modification potential alone should make everyone run for the hills.
0/0	This untested vaccine has been allowed immunity from prosecution if there are side effects, that tells you everything. Side effects may be as little as a cold, or you may die.
0/0	This vaccination get more and more confusing. Not strange people dont trust it. We hear so many different things almost from day to day. I don't think the developers know a lot themselves
0/0	This vaccination programme is a "trial" All involved will be on trial in the future for assisting in genocide.

0/0/0	This vaccine is an mRNA which changes your DNA makes you GMO. Don't take this s***
1/1	This vaccine is at least very effective in stopping anybody from getting seriously ill. At the end of the day thats all is required At the end the of the day we are in lockdown only because of NHS pressure . If the vaccine can ease that then its more than enough
1/1	This vaccine is going to be game changer to the world even though it isn't as high an efficacy as the mRNA
1/1	This vaccine is needed for the mankind to live
0/0	This vaccine is not determine as the solution of covid19...
1/1	This vaccine is our solution and our only chance..!
0/0	This vaccine is probably where the zombies come from!
0/1	This vaccine is still being TRIALLED, there is no data to state if there are any long term problems, no data to prove its efficacy past a few months, and the biggest problem is that it is a brand new TYPE of vaccine, never been used on humans BEFORE. Understand peoples concerns!
0/0	This vaccine modifies some of your cells using synthetic RNA to make those cells produce a new protein. Long term effects of this are completely unknown, it is a brand new technique. Funnily most people won't eat GM food. So have you understood this and really thought it through.
0/0	This vaccine only took months...*months* to develop, not even a year. That's way too quick. Also, how do we know this isn't going to mess up someone's DNA? There's no transparency.
1/1	This vaccine seems very promising. I hope it works.

0/0	This vaccine will either be a great triumph in responding to a pandemic, or a complete catastrophe or perhaps not even needed, nonetheless I'm not putting anything in my body until at least 10 years of research into this disease, the vaccine to test for its safety efficacy and is it really neccessary
0/0	This vaccine will kill more than corona

0/-1	This video is for Capital, not meant to inform people.
0/0	This video said absolutely nothing about the side effects.....what a waste of time.
0/0	This virus is hurting 2% of the U.S. population. The flu also hurts people every year. People with weak immune systems should probably rethink getting the vaccine because of the virus strand. They should probably isolate all together until the epidemic is over if they want to make sure they live. They could also wait until their bodies are in better shape and then think of getting the virus.

0/0	This whole COVID-19 IS BS why we don't hear about the flu or any other deadly diseases anymore ALL ILLNESS ARE CONSIDERED COVID19 AND PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM HOSPITALS they will kill you faster than a trigger happy police Bill Gates said years ago they are looking for a vaccine to control the world population NWO-NEW WORLD ORDER I just believe all this is for a greater plain of corruption handed down by all countries there is no vaccine for stupid
0/0	This whole rushed process of less than one year development makes me question the legitimacy of the COVID-19 vaccine specifically. Not vaccines in general.
0/-1	This whole thing is disgusting the vaccine is a scam. If they really wanted to stop this so call SARS 2 virus they would come up with something to stop it from getting into the cell
0/-1	This whole thing is shrouded in corruption beyond belief

1/-1	Those are the same 46% who thinks chocolate milks come from the brown cow
1/1	Those at risk from previously eliminated disease (eg Infants, Elderley and those with suppressed immune systems) are at risk of death - and the Anti-Vaxx movement are complicit in this for weakening our species' herd immunity.
1/1	Those of you saying you won‚Äôt take the vaccine because ‚Äúyou do not believe it is safe‚Äù: get over yourself. Your beliefs do not override science and reality. Based on what we are seeing so far, the vaccine is safe. Granted, nothing in life is a 100 percent guaranteed, yet, those refusing to take the vaccine right now not because of reality-based evidence but because of some stupid ‚Äúbelief‚Äù, seriously?
1/1	Those saying they won't take it are the ones complaining we didn't have summer this year and the same will be for next year. Well done.
1/1	Those side effects look fine compared to the risk of my lungs being destroyed
1/1	Those side effects mean it's working. You're getting an immune system response as your immune system adapts to the newly introduced virus. It's worth feeling a bit crap for a day or two rather than having full blown diseases. I always have reactions to the flu jab, still get them every year
0/0	Those that will take the vaccine they are already dead stop trusting this shiiit vaccine rely on The lord for This solution any mere man cannot help the world
1/1	Those vaccines had the virus. Most of their danger was it could give you the disease because of this but were usually still better than getting the disease naturally. The first small pox vaccine was deadly but it was way better than a 60% fatality rate of getting small pox naturally. This vaccine and the next one do not contain the virus at all. Looking back on that is like saying I hope this banana doesn't taste like Apple because the last fruit I got did. It's biggest risk it does nothing for you or you have allergic reaction to its ingredients (not to the mRNA) which is something people allergies to vaccines will have to wait till it's studied more.
0/0	Those vaccines have NEVER been classed as safe for humans ..its a lie and the most dangerous experiment on humans ever in the history of Earth. They are not called vaccines by the makers called gene therapy !!!!!!!!!
1/1	Those who are not interested in taking vaccination should be kept in quarantine until the nation hit zero number of cases.
1/1	Those who refuse the vaccine should walk around with a hat with a bell on it.
1/1	Those who refuse vaccination should be charged for medical treatment costs. It‚Äôs not fair to make taxpayers or insurance purchasers subsidize them.
1/0	Those who want the vaccine should take it.
1/1	Though DT and his cronies are doing a poor job in helping States get the vaccines out there it is happening! Get your vaccine when available!!!!!!! And wear your mask!
1/1	Three potential vaccines less than a year after the outbreak. Everyone talking about how we can‚Äôt stay locked down forever should‚Äôve just stfu and do what they were told. Much less people would‚Äôve died and we‚Äôre probably gonna be able to end the lockdown in the next 6 months or so
0	Thx 4 sharing. It helps. I always wondered all that'.
1/0	Tin-foilers: "Lockdowns and mandatory masks infringe on muh rights!" Also tin-foilers: "The vaccine will put an end to all this? Try to jab me and see what happens, buddy!"
1/1	To a person like me with a survival chance of around 0%, 89% immunity does sound pretty good.
1/1	To anyone and everyone involved in the development of the vaccine...... Thank you.
1/1	To anyone worried about long term side effects: I really don't think there's any real mechanism to cause long term harm. As far as the mRNA itself, it's literally just strains of mRNA that code for (relatively inert) proteins. Our body uses mRNA to code for proteins all the time, so that isn't new. There's no virus involved at any point so there's no risk of infection.

There's no virus involved at any point so there's no risk of infection. The technology is pretty good at replicating how viruses work, and that process itself isn't associated with any long term effects. There HAVE been mRNA vaccines before, specifically the one for Ebola - which I believe was in stage 3 trials and got an emergency use authorization. I'm pretty good at examining potential consequences, and really the only thing outside of normal immune reaction side effects I can think is an excessive inflammatory reaction related to the delivery mechanism.

1/1	To recover from the pandemic, we need a truly coordinated and collective commitment to equitable distribution of vaccines.
1/1	To save lives and stop the pandemic, we must protect the truth about vaccines.
0/0	To save you all 13 mins of your life I will tell you how it works, these companies throw some chemicals together, your insurance pays said manufacturer trillions of dollars for you to be a guinea pig. Nah I'm good
0/0	To show statistical significance for a virus of this type, a vaccine must show efficacy, (save lives) period. However, when the overall death rate is between 0.2 and 0.4 %, there will be little to no benefit. In other words, SARS-COV-2 virus is far too weak right now to show a vaccines effectiveness rate numerically, at population scale.
1/1	To the all the wonderful scientists who worked on these vaccines. I thank you for all of your hard work and dedication. And to all the front line workers, lets pray that this nightmare will be over soon.
1/1	To the anti-vaxxers. A couple of allergic reactions isn‚Äôt equatable to the 1 in 1000 deaths we have already had in the UK.

1/1	Today I volunteered at a vaccine centre. It was hard work but worth it. Approx 650 vaccinations I was involved in. They also had good pens
1/0	Today I was eating my food and I choked so i searched it up. It turns out I am not alone millions of people choke so I now don't feed my kids so they can't choke and die
1/1	Today I woke up feeling 95% better! YAY! Still have a VERY SLIGHT fever, a tiny bit of lingering headache but am able to sit at my desk and work fine. GET THE VACCINE. These "minor symptoms" taught me I want NO PART of real COVID.

1/1	Today is a good day. Today my parents and my aunt got their COVID-19 vaccine boosters!
1/1	Today is an awesome day! Slightly smiling face. Second COVID-19 vaccine dose. I believe in science and in helping others! Doing what I can to fight this pandemic! Thanks to all scientists, healthcare professionals, and volunteers!
1/1	Today is my 1st dose of COVID-19 Vaccine. And waiting 21 days for my 2nd dose.
1/1	Today is the day! My 72 year old dad finally gets his first vaccine. It has been almost a year straight where I've called him every day, making sure he was being safe and wearing a mask everywhere. I feel a weight lifting.
1/1	Today was a good day. I didn‚Äôt expect to be as thrilled or emotional after receiving my first dose of the COVID_19 PfizerVaccine, but here I am
1/1	Today was a great day. Mamma Mia got the 1st shot of the Covid vaccine today!
1/1	Today we celebrated the one millionth first vaccine dose given in the south west, at our vaccination site at Taunton Racecourse ‚Äì an incredible achievement by teams across the region
1/1	Today's report of @Merck dropping their covid vaccine program d/t lack of adequate immune response tells us just how damn lucky we are to have such high efficacy vaccines so quickly
1/1	Today, I‚Äôm a little extra thankful for science and modern medicine. Thankful for the brilliant, hardworking humans who made this happen. Thankful for another layer of safety to my patients. Thankful for a little glimpse of hope. We all got the vaccine!
1/1	Today‚Äôs sunrise is for my mum who gets her vaccination at 10.20. Putting your life on lockdown hold when you‚Äôre just shy of 80 is tough. And she smashed it. Full of love & pride for her & all this amazing generation.
0/1	Tony Blair says it's 'inevitable in the end' regarding using #CommonPass for travel. The same person that said vaccination is the 'route to our liberty.' Not on our watch, Tony. We're just starting.
0/0	Too bad this covid vaccine is more technology than vaccine, and is messing with our dna/rna and immune system, and is experimental (don't get me startedüò´)
0/0	Too many are jumping to get this vaccine thinking it is a lifeline, when it could be a sinker.
0/0	Too many bad stories and too much at stake with the health of people I don't trust your vaccine
0/0	Too quick to be putting a vaccine out, to many questions about the long term side effects for taking it.
0/0	Too rushed I would not feel safe taking first batches of any of it anywhere. Long term impact who knows!
1/1	Took Covid-19 Vaccine today.. Its totally safe. Please take vaccine when your turn comes.
1/1	Took mum to get her 1st Covid vaccine today. So happy for her after 10+ months of isolation. She finally has light at the end of the tunnel
1/1	Took my in-laws to get vaccinated yesterday. There was a small anti-vaxx protest by one door, w/ a few people carrying signs about how the vaccines contained mini-chips that were going to be used as tracking devices. Man, wait till those people find out about cell phones.
1/1	Took my second dose of the covid vaccine few days ago and I am fine. I am pro vaccine because yes I work in the ER at a hospital and I care about my family. I want to keep my daughter safe and I was not harmed by either vaccines.
1/1	Took the vaccine sino pharma and i'm still well and alive!!!
0/0	Total BS. Vaccines are proven to cause serious harm to the immune system. AVOID!
0/0/0	Total nonsense!! The vaccin is already mutating... its a normal flu virus!! Its a plan of WEF!!! The world will be hel!
1/1	Totally Agree. Every nation must have access to the vaccination and the third world countries need to be assisted to get them administered.
1/1	Totally agree. We discussed it on our village site and most people had some sort of reaction for a day or so e.g. shivers, headache, pain in arm. But all were delighted to receive the vaccine.
0/1	Totally bonkers taking it....oh they have also waivered off any rights of prosecution too.
1/1	Totally get a shot.
1/1	Totally going to get it.
1/1	Totally worth it so that we can reduce the spread and hopefully get closer to normal this year!
0/0	Trials? Are you kidding? Real trials go on for years.
0/-1	Triggering Article 16 was a big mistake and EU heads should roll. BTW there are 4 mutations of C-19 already so the vaccine(s) being "smuggled" will be a placebo for the next pandemic outbreak - they have an efficacy of 50% on the variants already. So within 5 months a new vaccine will be doing the rounds or not! The Dutch trying to sell pork to the Muslims or are you not confusing the Dutch customs officer confiscating the Brits ham sandwiches? - which caused an outrage and made headlines on 1 Jan 21! Recently migrants were rioting in the UK, and set fire to army barracks housing them as a protest of the C-19 outbreak in their camp - or was this just a spot of bother in your opinion?
0/0	True story, person tests negative for ‚ÄúCovid‚Äù 3 times and is in good health. person receives vaccine and becomes seriously ill immediately. ALL with knowledge of this are worried and accept vaccine as the culprit. Medical professionals acknowledge vaccine reaction day/day after
1/1	True this is for our protection from Covid19 virus. This is safe and very effective. It will help to prevent COVID 19, reduce its number and ultimately eliminate COVID pandemic.

0/0	Truth will prevail. It‚Äôs very hard to fully understand what is going on from the information that we receive. There are holes everywhere. We have to stay aware. Question everything and by all means don‚Äôt get in line to receive the vaccine first!!!!
0/0	Truth. Vaccines crash your immune system. We need liposomal Vit C, D3, colloidal minerals (incl silver), organic non-GMO fresh fruits and vegetables.

1/1	Two days post dose #2. Sore arm both times but nothing else!
1/1	Two days post dose¬†#2. Sore arm both times but nothing else!
1/1	Two groups (especially in the elderly and immunocompromised) that are protected by herd immunity already with every other vaccine, like polio, seasonal flu, mumps, etc. If you ain't either of those, there's no excuse to not use the vaccine.
0/-1	Two health workers got sick yesterday from it in London. Very sick. Why do you need it when 99.97% get better?
0	Two mice are in the pub and one says ‚ÄúHey, have you had the new covid vaccine yet?‚Äù And the other replies‚ÄúWhat?! Are you frickin crazy, they haven‚Äôt finished the human trials yet!!‚Äù
1/1	Two of the major vaccines have over 90% efficacy, which means that they will dramatically reduce the likelihood of infection.
1/1	Two other positives of the Oxford vaccine is that it should only need to be stored at 2c to 8c, and it costs just over ¬£2 per vaccine to produce, they are offering it to the UK and EU at cost price.
0/-1	Type 3.... people who are afraid the vaccine was magically created too fast and it's not safe yet....
0/0	Typical socialist: he kills people with poor management of the virus, then kills more with poor management of the vax. Not unlike China's mismanagement of diseases that swept through Mao's China, after he'd had all of the doctors killed for being western educated‚Ä¶

1/1/1	UK is vaccinating at a per capita rate equivalent to more than 2 million per day in the US. Hope we can get there soon.
1/-1	UK studies found even the viruses that escape the immune system and are stronger against vaccines show a 100% reduction in transmission
1/1	UNICEF announced new a deal with Serum Institute of India to access 1.1 billion doses of AstraZeneca/Oxford and Novavax vaccines at approximately $3 per dose for the poorest countries.
0/-1	UNICEF is a tool...devil instrument for destroying lives.

0/0	UNICEF you are sickening! Mouthmasks, experimental injections... you need to be taken to court for crimes against humanity!
1/-1	US: Pfizer has found the vaccine GERMANY: BioNtech has found the vaccine
1/0	Ubiquitous viruses are fought and defeated primarily by the T-Cell lymphocytes within our immune systems, Not from antibodies. The entire narrative that is being heavily perpetuated by the science community is False and they must fully understand this. (This is fundamental immunology, first term, first lesson, Chapter -1 "Steps leading through respiratory virus infection, to immunity").
1/1	Uganda has ordered 18 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine at $7/dose. Adding transportation cost, it will cost $17 to fully vaccinate one person with it, the govt said. The vaccine will be used for people above 50, those with underlying conditions and for essential workers.
1/1	Ugh I‚Äôm so pumped for the vaccine even though I despise getting stabbed by a needle
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1	Ugh I‚Äôm so pumped for the vaccine even though I despise getting stabbed by a needle.
0/0	Ugh! Scary. The Pfizer vaccine seems more lethal.
1/1	Uh you can still get the flu when you get the flu shot so it‚Äôs the same idea. Vaccines don‚Äôt stop you from catching a virus, they prepare your body for when you get the virus so that you have antibodies, or a defense built up to it so that your chances of surviving are much higher. Vaccines also help us achieve herd immunity. Idk why everyone keeps asking this same question, check the other comments for more detailed answers.
0/0	Um also the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are both only available under an FDA EUA‚Äîemergency use authorization. Neither is generally FDA approved at this point.
1/0	Unfortunately I'd say about 25% of Americans will refuse the vaccination.
1/1	Unfortunately, some people haven't enough of confident to take covid vaccine while some of theme are willingly to accept it just for the security. In my opinion, i would allowing myself to accept covid vaccine completely just to be secured from sickness!
0/0	Unless I am physically restrained and literally force to be injected with this garbage then I will never take it.
0/0	Unless it's mandatory I won't have the vaccination as I have I'm not sure from reading all the answers here it will be worth it, also I no one has even considered what the side effects might from having this vaccine.
1	Unless you‚Äôre over 80 just try not being a pussy.
0/0	Unless, the politicians and upper echelon of society take it first...I wouldnt touch it with a 10 foot pole!!
1/1	Unpopular opinion. We need to increase vaccines to these less fortunate countries. If it takes longer to vaccinate these areas covid has more chances to mutate and make the people vaccinated less safe
1/0	Unsure about taking the #CovidVaccine Do it for this gentleman. R.I.P you beautiful young man Red heartRed heart
0/0	Until people understand that the same people who sell the cure, make the disease.. will never know how the system works.

1/1	Vaccination TO THE MOON
0/1	Vaccination basically means guaranteed casket when #second and #thirdwave arrive.
1/1	Vaccination campaigns and publicity will likely increase that number, i believe. Importantly, politicians and public figures must be out there promoting vaccination as soon as it's available - antivax morons already have a head start
1/1	Vaccination can help reduce the spread of infection.¬†Therefore, it is important that as many people as possible choose to get vaccinated
1/-1	Vaccination can mean the difference between life and death
1/1	Vaccination did save life. But it is like all medication that few of you may have some side effects, eg allergy reactions. Nightmare is not caused by Vaccination.

1/1	Vaccinations are giving children a small (EMPHASIS on small) amount of disease chemicals so their bodies can recognize it and fight it off easily.
0/0	Vaccinations in Israel began 49 days ago. Second doses began 28 days ago. People at high risk were prioritized. Nearly the entire elderly population received a second dose more than two weeks ago. So why are serious cases higher now than early January?
1/1	Vaccinations not only protect your child from deadly diseases, such as polio, tetanus, and diphtheria, but they also keep other children safe by eliminating or greatly decreasing dangerous diseases that used to spread from child to child.

0/0	Vaccine dispensing sites are worth nothing if people don‚Äôt use them, or don‚Äôt trust them, perhaps because of patterns of¬†unfair treatment¬†in interactions with health care providers and government services.
0/0	Vaccine doesn‚Äôt stop the spread. Even if everyone got the vaccine the virus can still spread. The virus is likely to stop you from getting very sick if you get covid, but not certainly. Basically, we all are gonna get covid and that‚Äôs the only way out of this

1/1	Vaccines are a tool, not a panacea. Missing from our approach to managing covid-19 are not just drugs but tests that are accurate, fast, simple to take, cheap, & plentiful. The fed‚Äôl govt needs to make the development/production of such tests a priority.
1	Vaccines are almost too successful, I remember as a boy listening to my grandma talk about the world she grew up in before vaccines. She was always so grateful that vaccines were invented so that we didn't have to experience that

1/1	Vaccines are incredibly safe and have saved millions of lives over the years. Vaccines are one of the best scientific advances of our time. Taking a vaccine is like giving our cells a college course for finding and dismembering viruses. It‚Äôs truly genius.
1/1	Vaccines are meant to attack the host, so your body's immune system learns to defend itself against the actual virus. This is why antivaxxers are a thing because they believe that big pharm and governments are trying to kill them, but fact is they're too uneducated
0/0	Vaccines are not mandatory. Encourage immune system defense with sunshine, fresh air (no mask), exercise, fresh fruits & veggies, supplemented Vitamin C/D/Zinc and proper rest.

1/1	Vaccines can be controversial for many reasons, and this video talking about how they actually work brings up an idea that is not talked about as often. Because of how vaccines work, people sometimes view them as counterintuitive. Because vaccines work by injecting a person with a small amount of the disease, or diseases, they are being protected against, people question how it works. When people are injected with the vaccine, it is common to experience side effects such as coughing, sneezing, inflammation, and fever. These symptoms, which are most commonly associated with becoming sick, sometimes make people feel like the vaccine is doing the opposite of what it is supposed to be doing. They go in trying to protect their kid from getting sick, so they often wonder why their kid starts to show signs of developing a cold or flu. These symptoms can easily be explained by what they are doing. They are working to trap things like bacteria and get rid of them from the body. After that, adaptive immunity kicks in and programs the body to get rid of these types of bacteria if they are introduced to the body in the future. Though the process and symptoms may seem harmful to parents, they are actually helping the child. When children are vaccinated against diseases, they have the opportunity to live a healthier life.

1/1	Vaccines do cause severe side-effects, the thing is, THAT IS VERY VERY RARE, so it is worth taking the risk. Imagine you have to undergo a medical procedure to remove a tumor from your body, YES THERE ARE RISKS INVOLVED, but people usually take the risk! The thing with vaccines is, the risk is extremely low.
0/0	Vaccines do have side effects though. Moreover imunity against virus doesn't last more than 2 years
1/1	Vaccines do not even cause autism, though. The first time experience of getting them is disrupts routine and is an unpleasant sensory experience which makes previously-unnoticed autism obvious, but they do not trigger a massive rewiring of the brain, antivaxxers.
1/1	Vaccines don't harm, ignorance does.
1/1/1	Vaccines don't save people, vaccinations do. Let's all do our part to educate others! Here's a great video explaining mRNA vaccine technology. It is patently untrue when someone claims that the vaccine can infect you. People get jittery when they hear mRNA, but bear in mind, mRNA is just a derivative of DNA. Every living thing fundamentally relies on mRNA to exist. If the idea of receiving a novel vaccine makes you nervous, I reccomended you don't look up how little we know about COVID-19 infection long-term. We do know that other viral infections can cause lymphomas, sterility, cardiotoxicity, and many other problems long-term.

This is my reply to some saying to the vaccine deniers...then you are on your own. No, everyone has to get one. Because....There is no herd immunity forever. For any corona virus or we would have only one cold in our lives unvaccinated people will still keep spreading to the vaccinated becasue the total effect of all vaccines antibodies do not even last a year. The predicted antibodies off ALL vaccines are 3 to 7 months. About the same as getting it. The vaccine is to prevent death.

1/1	Well I‚Äôm ridiculously excited to be told I can have my first injection tomorrow evening. Wild horses wouldn‚Äôt stop me!!!
1/1	Well despite the snow and wonderful driving conditions, I managed to get my Covid vaccine this morning!
1/1	Well done Novavax! Now let‚Äôs get this rolling out and help kick this pandemic squarely in its genomic nuts!
1/1	Well done all Countries. This is really hard for us all. Remember, none of us have total freedom until the majority of the World is vaccinated. Let's all help each other best we can?
1/1	Well done to all the scientists for all their hard work. Onward and upwards into 2021
1/1	Well done to our fantastic scientists and all those involved, we need to move faster on executing this now
1/1	Well done to scientists & government for choosing the strategy in the face of fierce criticism
0/0	Well for me personally I've never had a flu vaccine and I've never gotten the flu coincidence I think not
1/1	Well if people r too stupid to vacinate , feel sorry for them and their families.
1/-1	Well if you would rather take your chance with Covid than the vaccine that's up to you . I suppose its a case of weighing up the longterm unknown risks associated with taking the vaccine against the know risks of dying from Covid based on your age. I would rather have the vaccine as I have less chance of dying .
1/1	Well im not leaving my house till i get my vaccine. I was actually lookin forward to the vaccine so i didnt die from just being near someone. Looks like im going to be stuck in for another year -_-
0/0	Well it is not FDA approved. It is still experimental. You have seen people getting severe side effects from it.
0/0	Well my mom started losing her hair so it must be a good thing right?
0/0	Well ok if u want you take it, risk becoming an SCP
1/-1	Well presented - thank you!
1/1	Well said and agree that on above all and priority basis the health workers and older people should get vaccination. Definitely, there is logic and prioritization is fundamental to get control over and overcome the obstacles of covid 19.
1/1	Well said! I‚Äôm a school nurse and got the COVID 19 vaccine 11 days ago with no reservations. I‚Äôm working hard to keep my students and staff safe.
1/1	Well said. "Lifesaving vaccines shouldn't be auctioned off to the highest bidder. In a global pandemic like COVID, corporations must put people over profits." Universal Covid-19 vaccines for all.
1	Well that's good but who knows how long it will be until it's rolled out to the public
1/1	Well that's really encouraging and enlightening. I may take vaccine.
0/0	Well they can shove it up that dark place as far as I am concerned, when asked about the over 65s as to the effectiveness of their so called wonder vaccine they answered in a typical vagueness well suited to a cheap skate politician... They did not have data on it in regards to the over 65s was their answer, in other words the jury was out on it but its safe to take it... a bit of a contradiction would be an understatement.
0/0	Well this vaccine will only help the body to tolerate the 5 g frequencyz more better...
0/0	Well yeah because it‚Äôs gene therapy and NOT a vaccine at all.
1/-1	Well, "socialist" government research funding laid the groundwork for the vaccine, before it was worth creating a startup to develop a product. And arguably, the distribution is failing because of a lack of "socialist"-style government planning, not because of red tape.
1/1	Well, I actually don't want to get this virus. It's pretty bad, and neither do I want to pass it on to anyone (even you). So I'll be getting a jab. Don't be so selfish.
0/0	Well, I can't be the only person scared shitless by these scientists giving it their best "reckon".
1/0	Well, I will take the vaccine if the pharmaceutical companies can be sued for disability or death caused by said vaccine
1/1	Well, I'm 67 years old and have multiple preexisting health conditions and I've been trying to get an appointment for the vaccine for three weeks and can't get an appointment through those sites and myturn.com
1/1	Well, I'm 67 years old and have multiple preexisting health conditions and I've been trying to get an appointment for the vaccine for three weeks and can't get an appointment through those sites and myturn.com and I haven't gotten anywhere. I've tried the phone number to although I don't have to because I am tech savvy. It's not us, it's L.A. County that doesn't have their shit together.
1/1	Well, I‚Äôm feeling absolutely fabulous today, more than 24hours after getting my initial #COVID19Vaccine dose. Make sure you have yours when it‚Äôs your turn, especially high risk communities
0/0	Well, for me these were not mild side effects, fever and chills and swearing? No, thanks, I won‚Äôt have it! Probably I had it already last February!
1/1/1	Well, have fun taking your chances everyone, I'm getting it. Really not a hard decision. You seem to be afraid of what you don't understand, but to me this really isn't scary at all. This is technology, and I'm taking advantage of it.
0/0	Well, it is your choice but don‚Äôt tell me to do it!
0/0	Well, vaccine was 100% effective in killing a doctor from Brazil last year. Look at the history of vaccine. The 1st polio vaccine that went out to the kids in quartine died from the 1st batch of vaccines. The news is so biased not a single episode has been based. I want ingredients for vaccine and pros and cons.
0/0	We√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re better off watching the Simpson√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s, as their predictions are spot on !
0	We√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had adverse reactions to vaccines before so we are not going to have anymore as the risk is worse on taking it than not taking it.
1/1/1	We‚Äôre definitely picking up speed now.
1/1	We‚Äôve become a nation of whiners and babies. Side effects, really? How about thank you to researchers who have worked tirelessly on this?
0/0	We‚Äôve had adverse reactions to vaccines before so we are not going to have anymore as the risk is worse on taking it than not taking it.
0/1	What !!!!! But they've bypassed the very one that they cannot /should not bypass (but HAVE) according to the Nuremberg Code. I just cannot believe this video. These people are actually publicly, happily, blatantly ignoring the Nuremberg Code. Previous trials for other covidviruses....all the animals died after a time.
0/0	What I do know is that I will not take it. Ivermectin is the answer not this Vac.
0/0	What I don't understand is how the vaccine immunity supposedly lasts buy natural immunity does not. ..that doesn't make sense to me
1/1	What I find pretty odd is that people seem to worry a lot about possible long-term effects of a vaccine while worrying little about those of COVID-19.
0/-1	What a LIAR
0/0	What a bozo... The executives of moderna are nonchalant about perpetrating the largest case of fraud the world has ever known.
0/-1	What a glorious testament to human ingenuity!
0/0	What a load of crap this all is, especially this channel itself, I don't trust vaccines
0/0	What a load of propaganda - "she's playing her part". That just demonises those who don't as 'not playing their' part' in keeping society safe. What game is the UN playing here. Let's not forget that it was the UN's cover up for China that contributed to the virus teaching pandemic proportions. The V sign I'm holding up is the British one, which means... This vaccine is too rushed. The UN can't say what is going to happen in the long run. More studies need to be done, but for the sake of business and profit, they are going ahead.
1/1	What a relief. My mother received her first dose on Saturday. She is 70, with COPD, and she has hunkered down for this entire pandemic. To think that, once the vaccine does its job, she can survive this virus as if it were a cold? Well, it is simply a huge relief.
1/1	What a trooper. A flu shot is really essential this year with the Covid pandemic. I will definitely be getting the Covid vaccine when that is available. Thank you for sharing
1/1	What a wonderful thing to do. Made me cry. 90 years young and wanting the vaccine . Awesome.
0/-1	What about Tiffany Doven? Is she alive since she took it? Anybody knows if she is ok?
0/0	What about all the people around the world a lot in the US dieing shortly after having the vaccine, sweeping that under the rug are we?
0/0	What about all the people that are having major reactions, with some dieing from these vaccines?
0/0	What about animal studies where the animals with Mrna vaccine got a cytokine storm. And the animals got very sick or die.
0/0	What about risks of long term side effects?
0/1	What about the Russian vaccine? I can't seem to find scientific papers about it (just political-biased news) and it's the only one that's coming soon to my country. Plus there are news talking about renal and circulatory problems that happened to people in the test phases that they kept in secret until now. That's not that alarming but it is pretty unconfortable to decide about getting a vaccine with that kind of doubts.
0/0	What about the ingredients? Never hear about them. No thank you!
0/0/0	What about the man that died from it right after getting it today in the media idk if it happened today or yeaterday n he wasnt old that I know of
0/0	What about the nano technology particles in the vaccination and the long term safety implications of nano particles in the human body and for what reason .
0/0	What about the stories of babies who have a life of suffering after a vaccine? What about toddlers who cease speaking and develop autism after a vaccine? Did you know that 1 in 30 children in California are autist? And that 10 years ago it was 1 in every 1000? Did you know that the same symptoms of mercury poisoning are the same as autism?
0/0	What about those cases in Norway where 23 people died after getting the jab?
1/1	What annoys me the most is that Melissa is anti-vax because her daughter can't get vaccinated so her daughter actually relies on herd immunity to not get seriously sick. Yes there are certain cases where vaccines are bad for a specific person but in my opinion I believe that this is all the more reason to be pro-vax because then you rely on herd-immunity to survive.
0/0	What are the long term effects? What about what it does to pregnant women and their babies? Oh wait, we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôll happen yet.
0/0	What are the long term side effect? We do not know yet. We don't know what would happen in a year or 2. Or 10, 20 years. They don't even know if it will stop you from getting the virus.
0/0	What are the true ingredients of covid vaccine? Me & my family won't be taking it!
0/1	What are you all afraid of? It is not us who ask questions that are afraid. We don't non comply because we are scared...it's quite the opposite really. Much harder to watch the masses become storm troopers than it is to wear a mask
1/1	What are you going to do if people start dropping dead from the virus? Take the vaccine
0/0/0/0	What concerns me is that safety tests can only test for known problems, unknown problems are only revealed by time.
1/1	What do anti-vaxxers and Russian roulette players have in common? They risk their lives.
1/1	What do you want us to do? Stay locked up indoors? Any person will take their chance to rid society of this pandemic by taking the vaccine. It‚Äôs killing the people not just medically but socially, mentally, physically, financially and emotionally.
0/1	What ever happened to herd immunity through letting your immune system do it‚Äôs job
0/0	What good is a vaccine that is supposed to especially help the frail and vulnerable if it kills them.
0/0	What happened to .....My body, my choice! I guess they conveniently forgot that line now that the narrative doesn‚Äôt fit the agenda.
0/1/-1	What happened to flu season, no more ,it's gone.
0/-1	What happened to the immune system God gave us to fight off viruses? My hope is the covid will settle down during the spring just like the cold/flu season do.
1/1	What happened to trusting the scientific community and your doctors?
0/0	What happens if u take the vaccine and something bad happens....u can't sue them.
0/-1	What has science ever done for us? TV Off.
0/-1	What if it contains micro scopic metal particles. Making you a better 5g antennae
0/1	What if you find out 5-10 years later if it does major organ damage? You cant sue them. Govt has provided vaccine companies with liability protection. So you are screwed!
0/0	What if you have an underlying autoimmune condition? I'm concerned about vaccines triggering a flareup.
1/1	What is a vaccine ? Vaccine is : death virus ( basicly ) Why we need it ? There is no medicine yet effected to this virus ; our only wappon is our anticors ! And when we got vaccineted , our body learns the new virus and starts making anticors... so we got ummin What if we dont get vaccinated ? Then we will meet the original virus ! And our body will start producing anticors also , but this will take time and will be after the virus gets all over the body.. Can we still survive ? Yes of course ! %99 ! But if u get vaccinated , your body will learn the virus and yor chance will be : %99.99 What about side effects ? There will be side effects , like all the other vacvines ! And now my question : what about the side effects of the real virus ? After they stay in yor body for weeks , after they conqouer yor livers , vines , throat ! Have u ever though about the side_effects of the covid 19 ? Anyway.. the choise is yors.
0/0	What is going on in the world, is truly bizarre! To the extent that in just the past few short months, all virology and immunology textbooks ever printed in existence, are being re-written as we speak, the premise to all empirical scientific methodology, logic and reason.
0/0	What is going on right now, is known in epidemiology as the pathogen endemic equilibrium phase, (viral stasis) and is perfectly normal. Virulence weakening and dilution is what always happens when mutations and naturally acquired herd immunity is occurring throughout the populations. Invariably mutation causes infection rate increase and lethality rate decrease. Vaccination at this stage, is essentially pointless.
0/0	What is potentially dangerous: rushing the approval process, then rolling it out admitting you are not sure how effective it will be, and admitting you need to measure the results on UK population before affirming fully its effectiveness. Covid vax scepticism is healthy.
0/1	What is scaring me is in a google search any alternative views about the vaccine are being filtered out. Maybe we need to remember the HIV Aids crisis. That has never gone away, people just manage to live with it. There is no cure
0/0/0/0/0	What is scaring me is in a google search any alternative views about the vaccine are being filtered out. Maybe we need to remember the HIV Aids crisis. That has never gone away, people just manage to live with it. There is no cure.
0/-1	What is the need to be vaccinated if the vaccines
0/0	What is the need to be vaccinated if the vaccines 1. Doesn't give you immunity 2. Doesn't eliminate the virus 3. Doesn't stop you from spreading it
0/0	What is the vaccine for? I know people who got the vaccine and still got COVID
1/1	What is there to see with their own eyes? News reporting that there aren't in fact thousands of people dying because of the vaccine? Amazing!
0/1	What is your age? My mother is 58 and took the vaccine 4 days ago, she‚Äôs experiencing soreness and a lot of fatigue. Immediately after the vaccine she reported dizziness. I‚Äôve definitely noticed the decline in her energy and loss of focus since then
0/0	What people don't understand is that Western Medicine is built for profits not cures. Just imagine if every disease and illness known to man is cured. How will these pharmaceutical, CDC and FDA make their money??? So remember this when you go to a doctor or deal with insurance companies or medication all of this are made for profits only. No one ever in the history of medicine talks about boosting the immune system the frontline to fighting off bacteria and viruses. These drugs that put out in the markets are designed purposely to have side effects to keep you depending on Western Medicine.
0/0	What people learn from history, is that people never learn from history. I'm not taking any mRNA created from eugenicists
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	What scares me most about this is there is a No Liability Clause which means I cant sue them and recieve compensation for any damages that might be caused by this even up to death
0/0	What should scare you even more is it‚Äôs changing your RNA; your bodies blueprint and the changes are permanent and irreversible. Gates wants to depopulate by 3 billion. He plans on doing this with vaccines.
0/0	What the f***!!! Big pharma should test their mRNA vaccines with these two pathetic weirdos. They are creepy as hell. Now I'm really really scared.
0/0	What universe is 40,000 participants a good number ?- especially when most Conditions take 1 yr to show itself ! A 2 month window is a joke and anyone who can't see that nor bring it up is a joke.
0/-1	What virus???
1/1	What we also need is less Americans to refuse the vaccine!!!
1/-1	What we need to know is when the public can get there's and can we go on line to sign up
0/0	What will the covid vaccine do to my body? That‚Äôs a simple question, not a damn thing
0/0	What would be the purpose of a vaccine for something with a natural survival rate of nearly 100%?
0/0/0/0	What you NEED to know is that NOBODY knows the long term effects.
0/0	What's dangerous is those who don't even consider anything outside the info. they are given by Govt and the vaccine companies. Vaccines companies are in this to make a huge profit and help the Gov. agenda. That's it. This is why Gates moved away from computer software.
0/0	What's not to trust about a for profit, already paid for, rushed vaccine? I'll hold off and let others be the real world testers thank you.
0	What's the technology used in the vaccine? And why? What for? My Body belongs to God and His Holy Spirit lives in me, Jesus Blood Protects me from plagues. So, No thanks! Only Trust God, and not man.
1/0	What? You seem to not only not understand how the phases of the vaccine trials work, but also that speed and haste are different things. No steps are being missed.
1/1	Whatever it was it wasn't the vaccine.
0/0	What‚Äôs in the vaccine? Like the specific chemicals or whatever that make up the COVID 19 vaccine.
0/0	What‚Äôs next? Your local dealer making a vaccine, don‚Äôt know how we can trust these people. He said a ‚Äòdecent‚Äô vaccine üíâ decent isn‚Äôt good enough
0/0	What‚Äôs the password for the 5G hotspot microchip they implanted in you?
0/0	What‚Äôs the point of a vaccine when you still have to wear a face muzzle and be socially distant!
0/0	Whe all be transformed in mutants, like Wolverine!
1/0	When Anti-Vaxxers refuse they vaccine they must also be made to sign a waiver that neither them or any of their family will receive treatment by the NHS when they catch COVID-19, and they are locked in quarantine until they die/recover. Simples!
0/0	When I can see documented studies outlining long term effects, I‚Äôll consider it. Until then, I will pass.
1/1	When I get my second vaccination it will be on my grindr profile and I'm very OK with that.
0/0	When I got the flu shot I was in the hospital for 2 weeks never again as far as covid shot I‚Äôm not sure I will
1/1	When I had my COVID-19 jab I had a slight sore arm for two days and that was it,Surely that‚Äôs got to be better than risking getting COVID-19
0/0	When I was young, one of my friends woke up paralyzed from the waist down one morning after receiving a vaccine. I think vaccines are great, but there's no way in hell anybody will force me to take one that I don't want. I think I'll let the rest of the world get the Covid vaccine, then there will be reputable data to base my decision to either get it or not on.
1/1	When a population takes vaccines, it leads to a herd immunity effect.
1/1	When a safe and effective vaccine is found, COVAX (led by WHO, GAVI and CEPI) will facilitate the equitable access and distribution of these vaccines to protect people in all countries
0/0/0	When a vaccine is safe and effective you don‚Äôt need to promote it no?
1/1	When and where can I get it?
1/1	When can I get mine?
1/1	When did British people become so stupid that they rather believe conspiracy theorists than scientists?
1/1	When domain generalization really matters: Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine appears effective against mutation in new coronavirus variants
0/0	When falsehood becomes institutionalized, truth is seen as rebellion. I will not get the vaccine.
1/1	When filling out the registration forms for the drive thru vaccination sites, is it necessary to fill out the reason for the appointment? I really want to get this done as fast as possible.
0	When it 'normally' takes between 10 to 15 years to develop such a vaccine and one miraculously comes out in a few months . . . . no wonder I'm sceptical! AND, to add further suspicion, the leading provider insists on the buyers signing a liability disclaimer . . . . what am I supposed to think?
1/1	When it becomes available to the non essential public I will be the first in line.. protecting my own. And my elders.. sleves rolled up read to go.
1/1	When it's offered I'm going to take the vaccine.
1/-1	When most of this makes sense cause you learned it in biology
1/1	When my mum had her first vaccination we were both so relieved.
1/0	When people have an IQ of below room temperature
0/0	When people know about possible long term effects of covid-19 i'm sure lots more people will become wary.
0/0	When pharmaceutical reporters are praising something, then I guess that qualifies as an advertisement.
1/1	When presented with an opportunity for a vaccine, don‚Äôt wink at it, grab the opportunity. It could be the difference between life and death.
0/0	When someone says "just because it's safe" in regards to an experimental vaccine should give us pause. Remember DDT was "safe"!
1/1	When someone suddenyl become knowledgable about how vaccine can be developed just by google searching stuff. And then dismiss all valid scientific evidences.. Yea you have the right for your opinion but science is not based on Opinions but on facts and evidences and discrediting years of research and such is soooo bafflinf at best.
0/1	When someone who was PCR "positive" for Covid dies in a motorcycle accident: they say "+1 covid 19 death". When someone dies just after getting the Covid "vaccine" they say "he would have died anyway, just a coincidence, not the vaccine".
0/0	When the government says safe and effective so many times I know I should run for the hill
1	When the vaccine is available, I will get it as soon as possible because I believe in the science behind it and believe the benefits greatly outweigh the risks.
1/1	When this is all over the UK people will be thanking the goverment for their Covid rollout program which got the country back on its feet long before anyone else. The EU will be looking at themselves and asking some very serious questions about their own response. Rightly so too when lives are at risk.
0/0	When trump gets his, I'll get mine. Makes no sense to just blindly get it the moment it comes out like a damn sheep.

1/1	When will vaccine be release, I m waiting for so long
1/1	When will we get the vaccine at our places anyone? Asia
1/1	When you are offered vaccination ACCEPT it. I come from a time when polio was still a scourge and none of my friends, or I, had the chance of a ' jab ': some were left with marked deformation, I was lucky with just a thinner left leg and shoulder higher than the other. Unfortunately my being canted to the right was a major factor in my spinal problems as I grew older, resulting in major surgery in my 30s.

1/1	Whether some side effects may or may not occur, I do believe the pros will outweigh the cons, and I will rather have side effects, than to end up dying from COVID-19.
0/0	Whichever way they spin it, the simple facts are the corona vaccine doesn't really work but there's too much money riding on it, they have to push it.

0/1	While the vaccine was developed in record time it is important to know that it has passed all the necessary requirements for emergency use authorization than any other medicine or vaccine requires.
0/0	While your information wasn't useful at all !.you're upbeat and positive personalities make me more scared than ever before !. It comes off very stepford wivesy !. And the fact that you're expected to take this for lack of better words experimental vaccine.and no one knows what the side effects are going to be I mean no one knows what the side effects are going to be. And the government makes it where you cannot hold them liable for damages !. No I don't buy a car without a warranty !you're not going to put a experimental vaccine inside of my body and tell me well it may work it may not work and who knows what it's going to do !. When your kidneys are shut down, your heart is firmly damaged, and your kidney cease to function because of this experimental vaccine. And you and your family have no recourse financially.Because the government decided that there will be no liability to this vaccine yeah I don't think that's fair !. I'm not going to be pfizers guinea pig !.stay safe people and take the vaccine I think all of you should take the vaccine !.
1/-1	Whilst I agree that it is much better to have the vaccine than risk Covid, the statistics James uses are not correct though. He says that one in every thousand people that get the virus in the U.K. die of it. If that were true and given that yesterday we heard that there were 70k deaths it would mean 70m people have already had the virus in the U.K.. if that was true we would not need a vaccine?
1/1	Whilst I agree that there needs to be more transparency between the government and the public to curtail scepticism in its many forms, I think that if people believe the vaccine is harmful and don‚Äôt want it, leave them be. Have them sign an agreement that they refused the vaccine and if they contract Covid, they have to cover their own treatment.

1/1	Whoop whoop!! Just received my call from @NHSuk for my #covid #vaccine!!! Yes please, I said, I‚Äôll be there!
0/0	Why China defeat covid without a vaccine?
1/-1	Why are Germans complaining? It is the country with the highest number of already vaccinated persons in Europe....Germans will always complain...
1/1	Why are people so stupid and ignore science and knowledge.
0/0	Why are the 300,000 that die from a single Covid outbreak in the US more important than the 100,000 that die every bad flu season? Or the 50,000 that die during even a moderate flu season?
0/0	Why are they giving vaccines to fragile / elderly people when they know there‚Äôs side effects. I mean, really
0/0	Why are they wearing masks if they got the vaccine?
0/-1	Why are you trying to make it less scary
0/0	Why are you using graphics instead of pictures of the actual virus? Is because you can't because it doesn't exist?
1/1	Why can't you just be compliant?! Your government just wants what is best for you and to save you from your own stupidity.
0/0	Why did the experiments on cats and ferrets given the vaccines did well until they came in contact with the wild corona virus and then they all died. Why do the pharma companies have full indemnity against being sued. Why are their so many people who have already suffered from these vaccines, seizures that can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be stopped or death. Why is there no investigation into the people in a nursing home who having survived the peak of corona now 24 of them died within days of receiving vaccine. Why the censorship of thousands of doctors professors and scientists who have facts that media will not allow us to hear. Why
0/0	Why did tromp not take the vaccine and instead took steroids
0/0	Why didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you mention the nanoparticles/aluminum in the Phizer and Moderna vaccine.
0/0	Why do I have to take the vaccine, if they‚Äôre safe, can‚Äôt I have the choice to take the risk or not?
0/0/0	Why do I need it if my body fights it off naturally.
0/0	Why do people want a vaccine? The Australian vaccine has been halted, as those vaccinated were testing positive for HIV antibodies. Could have something to do with the HIV protein they had included. You think? A 'Conspiracy Theory' over the last 10+ years has been that HIV was spread across Africa, hidden in vaccines. That doesn't seem too wild a theory now, does it?
0/0	Why do they stay in their running car? Oh yeah because when one gets vaccine they become weakened so someone else must take them back home in a car.
0/0	Why do we need a vaccine for a virus 99.9975% of ALL people will survive and gain herd immunity against? Why are there so few flu deaths from 2020? I guess we should be happy covid cured the common flu but. wearing cloth masks to keep out microscopic particles is the very same thing as putting up a chain link fence to keep mosquitoes out of your yard people! Wake up and stop listening to DR Fraudci now. This was a #plandemic. It was a test of our freedoms and you all failed miserably. Watch what happens when they make it mandatory to get the vaccine. That's coming in the next 2 months guaranteed. Mark of the Beast? You won't be putting that s**t in me tyvm.
0/0	Why do we need a vaccine to replicate what our genius immune system already does? Pretty sure the whole world is aware by now this pandemic has an agenda and it's not about our safety. It's about money and population control. Let me tell ya what they can do with all this nonsense...
0/0	Why do we still need to get vaccinated if we‚Äôve had covid? I have natural immunity.
0/0	Why do you refer to it as a vaccine when it‚Äôs an experimental biological agent ?!
0	Why do you trust these people, and you don't even know them personally they are trying to lower world population to five hundred million it is written on the Georgia Guidestones which is their mock ten commandments. They are using the vaccines for population control. Some people will have adverse reactions, and die.
0/0	Why does the whole world need vaccinated for a virus which is not dangerous to most people.
0/-1	Why don't rich people die of covid?
0/-1	Why don't trust in inmune system and 99.99 recovery rate ? I wouldn't trust in vaccine but everyone who want a shot I'm ok with that just don't force other directly or indirectly to take one.
0/0	Why dont you take your vaccine shot and take mine while youre at it, you fucking vegetable, and move along. Go suck BigPharmas cock and take their chemical drugs for your 15 allergies, diabetes and high blood pressure.
0/0	Why go in pains with something that doesn't work neither protect or heal!
0/0/0/0	Why has no other RNA vaccine ever been approved.
0/1	Why has this not been approved for EUA but drugs that dont work are????
0/0	Why is Bill Gates who is not a medical doctor involved in medical vaccines?
1/0	Why is everyone so anti-vaxxer in this comment section. Get the vaccine! Protect yourselves and others!
0/0	Why is it that when developing new drugs or vaccines in the past they were never allowed to be used on the Public because they had to be tested for years, but these vaccines have only been developed for a few weeks but are classed as safe , makes me a bit weary .
0/0	Why is the BBC not talking about the people who had an allergic reaction to the vaccination yesterday? Or the 4 trial patients (Pfizer) in US that developed facial paralysis?
0/1	Why is the vaccine scarier than the virus itself?
0/0	Why is there a warning label that men should bank thier sperm before a vaccine
0/0	Why lots of doctors don't want to vaccinate?
1/1	Why not ? It's FREE .
0/0/0/0	Why not let politicians and celebrities take it first, since they're all so confident in it?
1/-1	Why people are so offended when someone says they dont want to take a vaccine? I mean if you want to take it DO IT and if you think you'll be safe good for you. Why do you feel the need to insult and ridicule people who dont want to take it? Wheres the freedom in that?
1/1	Why plan,, should already been doing it
0/0/0/0	Why should I take a vaccine when I can't sue the company in case I get side affects that are deadly?
0/0	Why should I take a vaccine when the Covid19 has gone away? Now we are scared of a new kind of virus, what about that?
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Why should I trust a vaccine we know nothing about
0/0	Why should you trust it when their is no data showing it's safety? AMD how can we trust the studies when major corporations are controlling all these studies? Take it if you want, but I'm good, never will....ü§Øüò§

1	Why the Debate? Vaccines Do Work
0/0	Why the mad rush to vaccinate people with a highly experimental and untested vaccine that won‚Äôt stop you getting it or spreading it!? For a virus that has a 99.8% survival rate?!!
0/0	Why the propaganda for a dangerous experimental vaccine that is not even a medically defined vaccine? They are really promoting this for one reason only! Wake up! Keep yourself and your immune system healthy and people will be just fine till we reach herd immunity!
0/0	Why vaccinate already infected/recovered = faster way to get R&D vaccine cost back? No animal trials for these vaccines. Why not distribute Vitamin D and Ivermectin like India???? Follow the money.
0/0	Why vaccinate when no one is sick. It should be freedom of choice, stop taking away our civil rights

0/0	Why would I vaccine against the cold? 2 million dead this past year... how many died from the flu or the cold the years before covid world wide? I got covid and got over it no issue I was kinda sick for a week. Now I‚Äôm immune to it or at least will handle it much better.
0/0	Why would a vaccine be considered necessary for an illness with a survival rate of 99.97% if you actually catch it?... If rate of cancer deaths was reduced to 0.03% it would be considered a miracle.
0/0	Why would anyone consider getting a "vaccine" that alters your DNA?
0/0	Why would anyone inject a vaccine employing a brand-new platform with ZERO long-term safety data, for a disease that has basically no chance of killing them?
0/0	Why would anyone take a vaccine that not even the owners of the company that made them won't
0/0	Why would anyone wanna get this vaccine when the case fatality rate for those under 70 is .01% and the vaccine process which take 7+ years to develop safety was done in 10 months?
0	Why would anyone want injected with a defective chimpanzee adenovirus that AstraZeneca made called chadox1-s?
0/0	Why would anyone want this in their body?... Has everyone gone nuts?... Yeah why not!... Lets all play Russian Roulette with those lovely side effects we never had before!... Yeah... Great... lots have died now...
0/0	Why would someone get a vaccine if 10 percent gets the virus.
0/0	Why would someone need a vaccine if he recovered from the virus
1/1	Why would they even need to kill people with vaccines like that when there are nukes? It'd be a lot quicker.
0/0	Why would this be longer lasting than the immunity acquired by people who have already recovered from Covid-19
0/0	Why would we listen to anything WHO has to say. They have compromised themselves when they hid the truth of this pandemic from us.
0/0	Why would we need a vaccine when there are medications that work?!
0/0	Why would you take a untested vaccine for a virus that's 99.9% survivable and only inflicts the elderly with pre-existing health issues?
0/0	Why would you want a vaccine for a virus that‚Äôs never been isolated? A virus so deadly it‚Äôs cured the flu
0/0	Why would you want to give essential workers an experimental "vaccine"? It hasn't even been shown to prevent contagion.
0/0	Why you are giving this microchip for people....You are shameless
1/1	Widespread vaccination for the coronavirus means that the virus will not infect as many people. This will limit spread through communities.
1/1	Wife getting the Covid vaccine. A huge relief. Phew.
1/1	Will definitely do when available to me but health care workers and others need it way more than us right now
1/1	Will gladly take the vaccine

0/-1	Will we have to carry a vaccination certificate for when the Gestapo ask to see our papers?
1/1	Wish I could get a vaccine!
1/1	Wishful thinking, but I‚Äôm going to choose to trust if Biden and Fauci said it‚Äôs happening, it‚Äôs happening. That being said, I‚Äôm fully prepared to be disappointed.
1/1	With COVID cases surging worse than ever, getting vaccinated is one of the most important things we can do. But until the vaccine is widely available, socially distancing and wearing masks will actually save even more lives, and alleviate the pressure on healthcare workers.
1/1	With Yellow Stain gone and a vaccine in the pipeline ... 2021 is looking better already
1/-1	With all due respect, what about the older people in nursing homes and first responders?
0/0	With current recovery rates and Ivermectin available. why bother ?Just looking at the various stats makes it clear we do not need to immunize the entire population. Save the money to improve and build our medical facilities.
1/1	With the super spreading variants here, it seems to me it's pretty simple - get the vaccine or get covid.
1/1	Within 9 months we have five vaccines with excellent trial evidence & others to come
1/1	Within a couple of weeks my whole family should be vaccinated (other than me, I‚Äôll be at the end). It‚Äôs a really good feeling.
0/0	Without having studies to prove this is effective, it is reckless to do this.
1/1	Without the vaccine, we can't go and watch the sports event live!
1/1	Without vaccination verification it's extremely unlikely that any International travel will be permitted in future It's doubtful this will impact heavily on many of the anti-vax people...because they know the earth is flat
1/1	Without vaccines we would still have polio, smallpox etc. I will have the jab as soon as it is offered.
1/1	Without vaccines, schools will not be able to fully re-open.
1/1	Without widespread vaccination, we will not be able to end this pandemic

1/1	Woohoo! I got my first Covid vaccine today! (We had to double mask while there.)
1/1	Words cannot explain how joyous I am to know that my grandparents will get their first dosis of the #COVID19 vaccine this week!
0/1	Worst effects.... Does That include Death??
1/0	Worth mentioning--the pope has told Catholics that it's a moral imperative to get the vaccine.
0/1	Would I call pro vaxxers paranoid ? Most definitely that ls a title that could fit many of them. They get so paranoid with any desease lol.
1/0	Would another way of looking at these deaths be this: the same people who are fatally vulnerable to Covid-19 are also fatally vulnerable to the vaccine for the same reasons? If this is a correct statement, then doesn‚Äôt this cast doubt on the benefit of this vaccine?
0/1	Would be great but there is very little evidence they work.
0/1	Would like to see more reporting on second cases. ¬†I'm a doctor and I've seen plenty.
1/1	Would like to thank the NHS staff who gave me my vaccine yesterday, you were incredible

0/0/0	Would rather have the virus then go anywhere near the vaccine, never trust a jobsworth
0/0	Would someone please explain why Trump is spending OUR MONEY on a poison vaccine, when there is already a cheap, plentiful, and tested treatment/cure for Covid?
0/0	Would you fly in an untested experimental aeroplane, If the answers no then ask yourself why would you allow an experimental untested biological pathogen that for the first time in human history that actually goes in to your DNA and alters it . How much do you trust the government's and multi trillion pound corporation's that in the past gave us: Thalidomide, Asbestos in baby powder, HIV contaminated bloods to haemophilic children, None of these assaults on humanity saw and prison sentences, they are about to do it again as the world's governments have cancelled legal recourse and public prosecutions resulting from adverse reactions. Keep your holiday, Keep your fancy restaurants, Keep your needs and follys, Keep your Autoimmune diseases, Keep your horrors of science, I'll keep my DNA and know that fear did not drive me to give up that which is truly MINE.
0/0	Wouldn't take it if my life depended on it. Because it doesn't
1/1	Wouldn't the Super Bowl be an excellent time to boost vaccine awareness?
0/0	Wow !!!!!!! Amazing information that I don‚Äôt care about , still not getting the covid vaccine
1/1/1	Wow a lot of anti vaxxers in the comment. I can't wait to get my second shot soon!
1/1	Wow i‚Äôm a whole lot LESS skeptical about the vaccine now, it makes sense to me. Big shoutout to science !
1/0	Wow remember when we thought the Oxford vaccine would be ready in the fall? Now they are in line to be the fourth OR POSSIBLY FIFTH! What a damn shame. Stoked to know when the J&J is coming though!
1/-1	Wow this gave me chills this is amazing
1/1	Wow this vaccine will do amazingly.
0/-1	Wow this was a waste of two min save ur time they just say they‚Äôll track any bad reactions to the vaccine

1/1	Wow. By this comment section, i can definitly say: These community is garbage. Just get the vaccine retards

1/1	Yay, that‚Äôs great news.
1	Yay, they finally got a vaccine
1/1	Yay... I am up for it!!
0/0	Yea I know 3 people who have had both vaccines... And both have caught covid after!
1/1	Yea I'm nervous too, for those exact reasons. But I'm probably going to get it ASAP. I'd rather roll the dice on a vaccine and its side effects instead of Covid and its side effects.
0/0	Yea and why are they censoring all the doctors on YouTube that have been speaking against taking this vaccine ...if its safe why censor them what are they trying to hide. They must think the ppl are stupid
1/1	Yea dude it‚Äôs so safe !
1/0	Yea how bout dont take the vaccine. Stop letting the media and celebtraties convince you that the vaccine is safe. Many people are reporting horrible side effects like DEATH
0/0	Yea vaccines that cause deaths
0/0	Yea, I'll pass on being a guinea pig.
1/1	Yeaaaa had my vaccine today, halfway to freedom I hope, side effects with everything, its a chance you take.¬†ü§î
1/-1	Yeah I am not sure what they are going to do. I am sure that some people will take it after they see a bunch of other people do it. But some never will.
0/-1	Yeah I feel better. NOT! Its all adding up. I have suffered an anaphalactic reaction. Do not want to have another one
0/0	Yeah I'd rather not become a guinea pig, but thanks anyway.
0	Yeah I'll get the vaccine in the next life R IP
1/1	Yeah I‚Äôm good getting vaccinated and not being dead
0/0/0/0	Yeah because everyone is so excited for vaccines. It wasn't good enough that we drink and eat posion now they want us to inject it in to us
1/-1	Yeah because people listen. My moms anti vax but I got all my vaccines because my doctor said ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to get some vaccines you should her XYZ‚Äù and she just said ‚Äúyes ok‚Äù.
0/0	Yeah give it to old people first, in a few years time they‚Äôll be dead which they‚Äôll simply put down to old age not this over exaggerated virus
0/0	Yeah good luck making me take it
0/0	Yeah im 32 and in great health, no vaccine for me, i simply dont need it. If i were forced to tho, based on my research id take the jandj one
0/0	Yeah let's talk about the shortening of the protein multiplication process and not go too deep on how the trial phase was rushed.
0/0/0/0	Yeah no thanks. I'll take my chances with the virus.
0/0	Yeah right!! 143 deaths in UK shortly after vaccinating and government brush it under carpet as irrelevant due to underlying health issues. They‚Äôre the people we‚Äôre supposed to inoculating...how many deaths from these vaccines are acceptable??
0/0	Yeah they kill people don‚Äôt act like no one is dying from taking the vaccine B.G. The man who says we need to depopulate now all of the sudden wants to save the world with the vaccine, let that sink in
1/1	Yeah we are living in times that for the first time people are more afraid of a vaccine than the actual virus
0/0	Yeah you guys are gonna have to chase me down with a tranquilizer to get that shit injected in me. I'm straight on have fetal cells injected in my body.
0/-1	Yeah! right! I don‚Äôt believe a word of it and will never have it. The reason for my decision are to long to go into to here
0/0	Yeah, I am not taking that vaccine.
1/1	Yeah, I'm drinking copious amounts of tea this morning too. Hey ho. We'll get through this sure enough. And spring has nearly sprung, then summer and by then we should all have had our vaccines.....
0/0	Yeah, no I'm not sticking a rushed vaccine in me when masks can do most of the work (at least if the people I've read that from are true lol).
0/1	Yeah, no one wants a fake vaccine for a fake pandemic. Who could have imagined that?
0/0	Yeah, they sure aren't miracles, lol. As a survivor of two adverse events, I sure won't be taking this one.
0/0	Yeah,id rather be in a gunfight than take a vaccination
1/0	Yeah. I'll wait until it's reasonably available and hopefully any side effects that may have been missed during the rushed approval have been found out.
0/0	Yeah... I think I will wait at least until there are a few more guinea pigs vaccinated first..
0/1	Yep! Like I said my sons all up to date on his vaccinations I‚Äôm definitely a ‚Äúprovaxx‚Äù parent and don‚Äôt agree with the antivaxx movement. But it‚Äôs just not possible for a vaccine that has had less than a year of trials to be able to identify any long term side effects.
1/1	Yep. Lost my grandfather a few days ago to covid. I hope people can get this vaccine soon so no one has to deal with this any longer.
0/0	Yeppers..that's why I'm waiting. Never been positive for Covid.
0/0	Yes ... We know how it will work ... Vaccines at least annually ... Different strains ... New vaccines! ... The pharmaceutical companies must keep making billions ... The media and governments pushing these "miracles" ... While the stories of those injured get covered up
1/1	Yes I will have the vaccine when it is offered to me and I am well aware there is a risk. My sister-in-law, a healthcare professional had the vaccine 10 days ago and had a slight anaphylactic episode immediately after. She was OK after about half an hour.
1/1	Yes I will take it because I care about other people than just myself
1/1	Yes I will take the vaccine because I'm a teacher and I want to get back in my classroom with my students asap.
1/1	Yes I'm taking the vaccine. I'm tired of masks.
1/1	Yes autism cases are rising, and we do not know yet what actually causes autism, but to say its vaccines is crazy. Studies have been done looking at millions of children and no correlation between vaccines and autism can be made. One possible cause for the increase of autism cases is our better understanding of the illness and we recently changed many of the global questionnaires for autism diagnosis around the time of the increase as well. I don't think anyone should force things to people, but for those who cannot get vaccinated, the vaccinated population is their only defence. I've had all my vaccines and I get a yearly flu vaccine.
1/1	Yes because I'm not selfish. Just because it might not kill me doesn't mean I won't get someone sick and have it kill them.
1/1	Yes because getting Covid19 is not option me
1/1	Yes because it's important I do for those who cannot because of their health. I have a responsibility to keep up the heard imunity
0/1	Yes but refusing the vaccine is career limiting, as only NHS staff who have been vaccinated can work in front line, patient facing roles.
1/-1	Yes by taking the vaccine
1/1	Yes dr you are perfectly right all the front line workers should be vaccinated first they have and still are risking own lives to save others
0/-1	Yes half of the uk are smart
1/1	Yes i am, wanna get back outside enjoy nature, without governnentao restructions. Here in europe it causes Young deaths
1/1	Yes it is looking promising. It‚Äôs also technology and the type of vaccine that makes a difference as to why it‚Äôs happening faster.
0/0	Yes my elderly neighbour on one side of me was rushed to hospital last night with breathing problems 6 hours after receiving the vaccine and my other neighbours hand swelled up huge after he recieved his.
1/1	Yes of course I will, as soon as I can. I do not enjoy worrying constantly about being exposed to a dangerous disease. I want to be able to see my very elderly mother safely, to touch her. I cannot endanger her, so I must keep my distance. The vaccine is safe, a hell of a lot safer than viral infection. There is a new, highly transmissible variant reading rapidly around the world. The faster we can get vaccinated, the fewer of us will die, it is that simple.
1/1	Yes please vaccinate the stupidest ones firstly.. cheers mate
0/1/1	Yes the vaccine itself can in some cases cause a similar allergic reaction that the virus can. It‚Äôs extremely rare but obviously a potential side effect. Think of it as the non fatal form of covid - if you got covid, you‚Äôd have this reaction PLUS the other effects.
1/0	Yes! Absolutely.There is nothing more dangerous than this vaccine than any others, or else they would not make it available.I thought at first that I would want to wait a while and see before taking it, but at this point, I don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúdecide‚Äù to wait. I‚Äôm 32, I am not an essential worker, and don‚Äôt have any health risks. I have several friends who work in healthcare and have already received the vaccine, and they are all happy and healthy. Soon everyone I know who is a teacher or social worker will get it too. It will be months before I am eligible to get one.
1/1	Yes! I have taken the vaccine finally!!!
1/1	Yes! I will get a vaccine as soon as I am allowed to
1/1	Yes!!!!!
1/1	Yes, I agree everyone should take the vaccine.
1/1	Yes, I believe that vaccines work
1/1	Yes, I plan to get the vaccine. People who are more at-risk should be able to get it before me, but getting vaccinated is something that will help stop the spread of the disease, and I'll be able to go see my little nephew
1/1	Yes, I will get the vaccine once it is developed.
1/1	Yes, I will surely take the Covid 19 vaccine. This will help me in getting protection against the dreaded virus.
1/1	Yes, I will take the vaccine. I thought I would try to slip past in some queue if possible. So that I can take my second dose soon.
1/1	Yes, I will. I'd rather be a guinea pig for any possible long-term effects for the vaccine than for long-term effects of Covid. That said, it'll be a while before I am eligible (30s, no co-morbidities).
1/1	Yes, I would accept the vaccination invitation. Advice is not to have any other vaccine.
1/1	Yes, I would get a COVID vaccine.
1/1	Yes, I would like to take vaccination
1/1	Yes, absolutely. If people don't get it this virus won't go away. If I don't get it I'm no better than the people I consider the problem
1/1	Yes, absolutely. That's the only way we'll stop the pandemic.
1/1	Yes, and I regard anti-vaxxers as criminals who should lose custody of their children.
1/1	Yes, because the anti-vaxxer rhetoric is ridiculous and fucking retarded.
1/1	Yes, because the risks of a vaccination complication are small.
1/1	Yes, because the risks of a vaccination complication are small. Typically, the problem is an allergic reaction - anaphylaxis. The rate of anaphylaxis for these vaccines are 11.1 in a million. [1] In most cases of anaphylaxis, no treatment was required, just careful watching.
1/1	Yes, definitely if a vaccine for Covid-19 comes out I'll get it, because we all know, we can't live our whole lives locked down
1/1	Yes, i wanna protect those around me.
1/1	Yes, it would be nice if we could get vaccinated. We are in category 1b, why are other groups being taken ahead of us? These vaccines and appointments are impossible to get.
0/0	Yes, there is little demand. Even ~30% of nurses say they are hesitant to get the vaccine disregarding any limited supply.
1/1	Yes, very much yes. there is the issue that if I do not take the vaccine, I can never visit my mother again, ever, since she has all the risk factors for COVID.
1/1	Yes, we are going back to normal, let the vaccine come in!
0/0	Yes, when you invest billions of dollars into vaccine development it becomes extremely difficult to allow a potentially better cheaper already existing option like Ivermectin on to the playing field.
1/1	Yes. Absolutely. My parents are high risk and elderly...I‚Äôd really hate to inadvertently kill them
1/1	Yes. Because I don't want to die of Covid19, or have my lungs or other organs damaged by it.My risk of death if I enter hospital because of Covid19 is around 1 in 60.
1/-1	Yes. But I won‚Äôt be first in line. I want front line workers and high risk people to get it first. This also lets me see if there are any major initial side effects.
1	Yes. Definitely. The trials of the big ones look solid. I'm keen.
1/1	Yes. For the safety of those around me. I believe in science and the scientific community.
1/1	Yes. I will get the vaccine the second it‚Äôs available to me.
1/1	Yes. I will get the vaccine the second it‚Äôs available to me. I keep hearing everyone to tell me to ‚Äúdo my research‚Äù and I have a bit but I‚Äôm not arrogant enough to think that I can do research better then those who have dedicated their entire lives to it.
1/1	Yes. If you care about the people around you you‚Äôll get the vaccine. The developers have all guaranteed all safety measures will be followed and none will be avoided just to get it out quickly.
1/1	Yes. In fact it has been 48 hours since I received my first injection of the Pfizer vaccine.I have parents, and friends who are at risk. I may be able to brush COVID-19 off, but they can‚Äôt. >80% vaccination is required for herd immunity, and I want to protect them because I care for them.
1/1	Yes. My mother is being vaccinated tomorrow. I and ecstatic about it.
1/1	Yes. Though I want to make sure people who aren't able to stay at home get it first which I believe is the plan in my state
1/-1	Yes. Type I diabetic.
1/1	Yes. Will take. It is the right thing to do. Same as with every other vaccine.
1/1	Yes... first day I can. Want life to get back to normal and feel it my duty to help protect the vulnerable
1/1	Yes.My parents and my extended family will be vaccinated before I am as they all work as nurses at the biggest hospitals in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. Once my entire family is vaccinated, I‚Äôll finally be able to sleep better at night.
1/1	Yesterday I buried my father. Today I go home a different woman than the one whose father got a positive covid test in January 2nd. Thanks again to everyone who wears their masks, who has gotten or plans to get the vaccine, and who are keeping each other safe.
1/1	Yesterday I got a second dose of Sputnik, side effects are the same as the effects explained in the video.
1/1	Yesterday I had my second Pfizer vaccine.
1/1	Yesterday United States vaccinated 2million in a single day. We are in a good position let‚Äôs increase the speed of vaccination drive
0/0	Yet somehow the deaths have gotten worse this month
1/-1	Yet the anti-vaxxers won‚Äôt be able to let this sink in but would happily believe the fake news off dodgy conspiracy theory pages
0/0	Yet we should believe the BBC and there reports. Like when they interview 100 people but only show the 4 people that stand there and say how they carnt wait to have the vaccine.
0/0	Yet, nobody knows of anybody that knows anyone that has outright died of covid that wasn't already dying with multiple comorbidities! The same people bringing us these "miracle vaccines" have also long been advocating for a drastic reduction of the human population.
0/0	Yet, nobody knows of anybody that knows anyone that has outright died of covid that wasn't already dying with multiple comorbidities! The same people bringing us these "miracle vaccines" have also long been advocating for a drastic reduction of the human population. 2+2= ?
1/1	You CANNOT GET CORONAVIRUS FROM THIS VACCINE. IT IS NOT A LIVE VACCINE. most likely they had covid already without knowing it when they got vaccinated. Please do some medical research.
0/0	You Forgot to mention that this mRNA uses human cells to reproduce itself, that could lead to DNA mutation and you have no study to proove otherwise
1/1	You all realize that if 75% of ppl take the vaccine we can go back to normal‚Ä¶ half of you all don't wanna take it because it takes you all don't wanna go to school
0	You are 100% correct. All this for a virus with a greater than 95% recovery rate. What on earth had happened to common sense and perspective?
1/1	You are SAF....... IF YOU TAKE THIS!

0/0	You can all take it but don‚Äôt make me or my Family that‚Äôs all I ask And good luck with a vaccine I hope it works out the best for you since there‚Äôs not much to know about it but I guess we‚Äôll find out in time more and more people that take it hope nothing bad happens to you all and end up being worse than the virus itself
0/0	You can be strong against any virus that comes your way, including COVID-19
0	You can build trust by being trustworthy. But we all that will never happen.

1/1	You can not travel or do any work or help anyone..without vaccinations
0/0	You can push it day and night, not taking it. :)
0/0	You can still catch covid with the vaccines. Or without it use common sense for me the vaccine was rushed just for a billion dollar profit. People die every day from other natural causes or other complication with in themselves thats part of live. Go to the dr for a stubded toe and you got covid and get charged 10,000 for a covid test that cost 8.00 to make stay healthy and be safe and this to shall pass.
1/1	You can take the vaccines, it will help to prevent death
1/1	You can take the vaccines, there will not be any side effects
0/0	You can't even trust their powder why would we trust their shots

0/0	You can't pay me to take it
0/0	You can't trust a drug dealer
1/-1	You cannot choose in the uk. But no worry we have the whole country covered soon. Vaccines r us. It‚Äôs what we do here.

0/0	You could never convince me to take a vaccine.
0/0	You couldn't pay me to inject that crap into my body!
1/1	You don't have to get the vaccine now, but it would be the smart thing to do.
1/1	You don't just vaccinate people to stop them from dying, you also vaccinate to stop them getting any other long term conditions that a virus may give.
1/1	You don't need to convince me to get the vaccine. You just need to get me the vaccine.
1/0	You don't want to cut your chances of ever obtaining the virus at all by about 2/3 while giving you 100% less chance of major symptoms? That seems like a poor choice in logic to me.
0/0	You don‚Äôt even really know what the long term effects may be! Stop using people as guinea pigs!
0/-1	You don‚Äôt get corona but it could kill some of immune system
0/0	You don‚Äôt have to worry about giving me vaccine keep for you

0/0	You gon die or turn into a zombie for real
1/1/1	You got the vaccine! That's such great news!
1/1	You gotta be a special kinda stupid to be more afraid of a vaccine than dying.
1/1	You gotta be a special kinda stupid to be more afraid of a vaccine than dying. Every one of us has been getting vaccinated since we were infants and that you are still alive so you can be paranoid is pretty solid proof your fear of this one is as dumb as it gets.
1/1	You gotta work on the people that decline the vaccine or are skeptical. Do more commercials, something.
1/1	You guys are doing such a great job informing us about the vaccine! Thank you! <3
0/0	You guys do understand that being against the covid vaccine is not the same as being anti vaccines right?
1/1	You guys r all dumb the vaccine has been tested a lot of times and y'all still think it's hazardous and risky lmao and also it's a new technology we aren't in the stone age LMAO
0/0	You guys seem so excited... tell you what, I will sacrifice my shot and give it to one of you

1/0	You had me until you said ‚Äúno risk‚Äù of getting what is being vaccinated against. This is inaccurate and misleading. We need unbiased truth. Thank you.
1/1	You have a choice: you can save your life and others...or you can take the same life away from yourself and others.
0/0	You have no clue of what the side effects will be until more people are vaccinated. You have a tiny sample to work with right now.
1/0	You have survived infectious diseases so far, due to vaccine?
0/1	You have two choices, one be Zombie ( By taking vaccine) or two be a Survivor ( By not taking vaccine). Your choice, Choose carefully
0/0	You kidding me?! Not enough people are getting the virus so we're purposely injecting, and making super spreaders????
0/0	You know as well as I do how dangerous the vaccine is!
1/0	You know it‚Äôs the end of the world when they force you to take the vaccine
1/1	You know that even if this death was related to the vaccine, FAR more people have died from COVID than the vaccine?? Like, its not even comparable. And therefore much better for your health and the health of others to get vaccinated
0/0	You know that it could take years to see if it's safe?
0/0	You know that it could take years to see if the vaccine is safe?
0/0	You know what it's not worth the comment. I'm not taking it
1/1	You know what vaccines do give your kids? A future.
1/1	You know what‚Äôs amazing? The coronavirus first arrived on our shores about 10 to 11 months ago. And look at how much historic progress we are rapidly making on the COVID vaccines! I am very proud of humanity‚Äôs biomedical science.
0/0	You know where you can stick your vaccine, don't you. It won't be in MY arm!
0/0	You made a huge mistake. You just altered you dna.if it dont effect you it will effect your children...if you will be able to have any.
0/0	You may also get cancer or die in a year or two of a violent reaction to something that used to be harmless to you (some scientists have suggested this). Who knows? Also, we will NOT be free to do whatever we want regarding the vaccine, as you will soon see.
0/0	You might see claims that the COVID-19 vaccine can make someone infertile or impotent, harm a developing fetus in the womb, make the immune system attack the placenta, or hurt a baby who is breastfeeding from a recently vaccinated mother.
1/1	You need to inject and youre ready to effect and wait the results if its injected vacc√≠ne is effect√≠v√© to you. Pray faith and believe. God blessed us.
1/1	You only have to vaccinate the kids you want to keep.
1/1	You people got vaccine when you was a kid your Tb.your polo shot and others you did ok this one is no different
1/1	You really can't fix stupid. They're just going to hurt themselves and sadly people with weakened immune systems. If they could be tried for murder, I'd wager they'd get it pretty quick.
1	You shold thank the pharma companies they will save us with these vaccines
0/0	You should drink a glass of water rather than taking this vaccine.
0/0	You should have never Injected the chinese Plauge into your veins.... whenever you hear the word CHINESE with a product, The very second thought is FAKE PRODUCT.....
0/-1	You shouldn't dismiss those people that are wary of a new vaccine as nut jobs. The swine flu vaccine had a 1/70 000 odds of giving people narcolepsy, something that was not known until long after. 1 year of testing is not enough time to accurately gauge these long-term risks. Narcolepsy is life-altering, you can't live a normal life after. If the Covid vaccine has the same odds, I for sure won't take it. I think many people here in Sweden will not since the narcolepsy issues became so news worthy here. If I were in a risk group, then probably but as a young person, it is not so obvious.
0/0	You take it and all your friends and family. I'll see what happens at least 5 years down the track. 30 years research on these types of vaccines, no success, in less than a year, success, bingo, suspicious?
1/1	You the man I got both shots no side effects but this keeps me assured. Thank you so much!
1/1	You turn up and what is in stock is what you are getting. I got the Pfizer vaccine and had zero side effects. Love it!
0/-1	You two youngsters have certainly drank the kool-aid. Do you do ANY research yourself or do you just believe what you are told? Never mind, i know the answer to that question. Sure hope no one listens to you, but unfortunately, i know some will.
0/-1	You wanna see ‚ÄúMind Control‚Äù? Tell your parents you are not vaccinating your child... And SEE...
1/1	You want a normal life again? Then take the vaccine!
0/-1	You want to know the cure? Stop watching the media.
0/0	You want to know why it's rollout has been so bad? It's hard to get the nasty stuff they put in the vaccine, that's why. They have to wait for the chinese to send it over.
1/1	You won't die The news reports the spectacular and exceptional which scares you. Millions of people have had it and there is 1 POSSIBLE death. You have a greater chance of winning something in the lotto. lol. Fear governs society.
0/0	You would be crazy to take an experimental vaccine. Just Google Pfizer criminal history.
0/0	You would have to be an idiot to let them inject you with something they rushed together.
0/0	You'd have to be a damn fool to get that fast-tracked vaccine.
1/0	You're a doctor, you have to give the good example
1/1	You're always this patriotic. So now be it again and take the vaccine asap
0/0	You're basically rolling a dice with your health at stake.
0/0	You're concerned about getting #COVID but you're not at all concerned about being injected with it? That makes sense.
0/0	You're not supposed to take it while pregnant or breastfeeding. What an overwhelmingly huge bummer, I guess I have no choice but to wait the next 15 years before I take it. Maybe we'll actually have data on long-term side effects by then...
1/1	You're phase 1 because your work helps more than just yourself. Keeping you healthy increases your ability to treat the rest of us that can't get the vaccine yet.
0/0/0/0/0	You're presenting theories as facts. mRNA technology has not been adequately or unequivacably proven. I do not want a chemical messing with my immune system. I'll boost my system naturally thank you.
1/1	YouTube could do a hell of a lot more to combat misinformation spread by anti-vax conspiratorial videos.
1	Young and healthy people can get very sick, too
0/1	Your "advice" is .... "dont listen to any negative things about it, everyone has to have it" ... cool that seems like an unbiased, responsible response
0/0	Your Not Vaccinating Me! I AM NOT Taking Any Covid-19 Vaccines! There Is No Covid-19 Pandemic This Is a Plandemic! Your vaccinations are In line with depopulation

1/1	Your idiotic anti-vax crap is ignorant and insane.
0/0	Your immune system works BEST
1/1	Your last line brought a tear to my eye. I am ready for this to be over too, I'm ready for people to stop dying, I'm ready for my parents to be able to hug and kiss their grand children. I'm ready for the world to be safe again.
0/0	Your natural immune system is stronger than any vaccine
0/-1	Your right their both a pair of sanctimonious hypocrites But maybe they both realise that the whole thing is a load of mass hysteria and like almost 100% of people in the country they have nothing to be worried about so were just getting on with their lives
0/0	You‚Äôre immune system is still more effective than the covid vaccine
1/1	You‚Äôre protecting those who cannot be vaccinated
1	You‚Äôre still glad you got all those vaccines when you were a kid, right? So get one against COVID. Please inform yourself before spreading misinformation.
0/0	Yup let‚Äôs just genetically modify our cells and just hope it goes well
0/0/-1	Y‚Äôall can take as much as this as y‚Äôall want. I‚Äôll be fine
0/0	Y‚Äôall finna turn into zombies
0/0	ZAMBIAN PRESIDENT IS AWAKE.... and he is warning his people to NOT take the vaccine
1/0	Zero Covid is incredibly easy to achieve. Getting to minimal cases more so. As many counties are proving. We just don't have the discipline. We have a narcissistic culture instead. Many don't have the intellectual capacity to do what needs to be done. So we're relying on vaccines
0/0	Zero would be the number of vaccines you need.
0/0	Zombie stage one.
0/0	Zombie vaccine coming soon, you take that shot I will load my magazines
0/0	Zombies by 2021? Wouldn't even surprise me.

0/0	a vaccine for something that has a 99.8% recovery. absurd beyond belief
0/0	a vaccine that has more short term side effects then the virus. We do not know about the long term side effects. No Worry there will be plenty of pills to sell for the vaccines side effects and more pills for those pills side effects. Thanks but No Thanks!!
1/1	absolutely fantastic process and implementation of the COVID19 vaccination drive by Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai.
0/0	absolutely no! Not nearly enough tests or results available yet.

0/0	after 2 / 3 years...give us update please
1/1	after all this debunking, and seeing all the benefits of vaccines, these people still only believe facebook ads and weird sketchy websites instead of actually scientists, who have studied their whole life in medicine and more.

1/1	all of our doctors, scientists are getting it. If they're going down, I want to go down with them bc I don't want to live in an apocalypse w/o tem
1/1	all the front line workers should be vaccinated first they have and still are risking own lives to save others
1/1	all those anti vax will appricate the vaccine a few years later
1/1	along with the infection rates, the anti vaxx sentiment has also spiked. i blame general distrust in the governments and the lack of education around this new type of vaccine, especially in the older generations who might not have access to educational resources / not speak english
0/0	also you fear mongering shills always talk about the long term effect of COVID. of which none are proven so far. but completely ignore the potential long term effects of an experimental vaccine. For example. the very likely effect on fertility. as this is mostly likely being used for population control.

1/1	as I told another user we would be foolish and a half to not utilize AZN in other cases especially after seeing its efficacy against B.1.1.7. It‚Äôs still useful to us. And I expect our mRNA vaccines will absolutely hold up. See Pfizer‚Äôs results.
1/1	as a licensed caregiver, i am eagerly awaiting my shot.
0/0/0	at greater risk for what? For catching a virus that for most people is less dangerous than the common cold? Taking the vaccine is much riskier, but if you want to take it, go right ahead!
0/0	back then i think vaccines did save lives because they were not in the hands of psychos unlike today.
0/0/-1	because for my race they make a different vaccine

1/1	congrats!! I can't wait til I can receive mine. It makes sense that younger people would experience more symptoms since their immune system is better, so theirs is on high alert, the older you get it just seems like it takes more to aggravate it... perhaps the immune system is just like someone who has seen a lot of hardship in their lives, they don't react as angrily to an incident.

1/1	don‚Äôt vaccine shop. Take the one that‚Äôs offered to you, they‚Äôre all good. Let‚Äôs get the pandemic over, then we can worry about getting boosted by a more effective one.
1/1	don‚Äôt worry about the Covid vaccine, I got it 2 weeks ago and I am fine
1/1	dude covid is here to stay and the variants will keep coming. we will need robust vaccine development deeply funded by govts. why is that so hard to understand?
0/0	dummy, I will let my body give me natural immunity , as nature designed me
0/0	effective for what?Tell us what's in the vaccine.And who was in the trials? and how old?And the comorbidities?What are the adjuvants in the vaccine?What are the long term side effects? Oh,yeah,there are no studies on most of my questions.
0/1	ell, what I have read thus far, the common side effects include pain at the injection site, fatigue, muscle aches or pain, joint pain, headache and depending on the vaccine is given, potential fever, which is short-lived according to the recent¬†authorization of the vaccine by the FDA

0/0/0/0/0	first of all da vaccine, im not gonna take the vaccine
0/0	flu vaccine took over a decade to bring to public, ask the experts if they will have the jab first and we can take it from there, that's not fake new on vaccines, I've had flu jab today. If the world has naturally produced a virus that has stopped the world (flu never stopped the world) how can a vaccine be found in the blink of eye ... nothing makes sense except we get the news we want to hear
0/0	flu vaccine, 100 years, still 40% effective and people die after getting it sometimes because it weakens their immune system. Vaccines are moronic if u take it EVERY YEAR.
1/1	for all those that donet want to get the vaccines, bring them to us that we want..!! Haha more for us then!..

0/0	he world will wake up and come together and ban 5g and that damn mirco chip, this is a world problem not just the USA, time to focus on what really matters. Don't vaccine
0/0	he ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù are not vaccines at all! They do not inoculate people who get jabbed, they just mitigate the symptoms but leave people susceptible to future infections once the antibodies wear off in as little as three months.
1/1/1	health care workers should be first for the needle
0/0	heared a group of people died after taking the vaccine!
0/0	herd immunity takes effect and Covid goes extinct.
0/0	hey aren't safe yet for anyone. Criminally negligent at best you lot.
0/1	his has led to fears that the vaccines developed so far might not work against these new ‚Äúmutants‚Äù because vaccines are based on teaching the body to recognize those proteins and attack them in future.
1/-1	honestly i saw a video about a vaccine in china and it seems to be coming along beautifully.
1/1	honestly im going to frame my vaccination card and put it next to my diploma
0/0	hope everyone knows...this vaccine is still experimental.....look it up
0/0	hopefully never
1/1	hopefully they ramp up the production during this review period, this way once the 26th comes we can flood the market and start vaccinating 3 million plus a week.. The light at the end of this very dark tunnel is approaching

0/0	i am not taking ANY VACCINE ! they told you about this years ago and in october of 2019 in the event 201 they told you that this first vaccine WILL NOT WORK AFTER THE 18 MONTH PERIOD THEY WILL BRING A MORE DANGEROUS VACCINE.. TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE DYING AFTER TAKING IT SO I DO NOT CARE HOW FAST THEY MADE IT
0/0	i am sure the government kool-aid crowd will justify this death.... but it is a wakeup call for what they DONT know about this rushed vaccine. Maybe the cure is worse than the disease in some cases!
0/0	i am very skeptical of it. i‚Äôm sorry i won‚Äôt get the vaccine. thats just my opinion

0/0	if f you can't sue the people who made the vaccine then we shouldn't get it.
1/-1	if i had to choose i'd take pfizer's lol
0/-1	if the genetic material gets in a cell, wont it produce more virus?
0	if the vaccine does not prevent infection, what is going to happen to my body?
0/0	if they havent made a cure for aids/HIV what makes people think they made the right covid-19 vaccine this fast?! u honestly must not be in ur right mind if ur going to get that vaccine.
0/0	if they havent made a cure for aids/HIV what makes people think they made the right covid-19 vaccine this fast?! u honestly must not be in ur right mind if ur going to get that vaccine. think ppl
0/0	if they try to force me , my 12 guage is loaded , i got plenty of ammo
1/1	if u don‚Äôt take it when u get the chance it would make the virus last longer and we won‚Äôt fight it and u can‚Äôt get back to ur normal life. It‚Äôs selfish. It‚Äôs completely safe they wouldn‚Äôt give it to us if it wasn‚Äôt. I have family members that have had it and they are completely fine.
1/1	if vaccines didn‚Äôt work, then why has the polio and measle rate decrease.
1/1	if we really want to get rid of Covid-19 and return society to a semblance of normal, we need to get most of the population vaccinated or infected. I‚Äôll take the vaccine over infection anytime.
1/-1	if were gonna fight..we fight here. No running away.
0/0	if you are a child of god you will not get this vaccine
0/0	if you can't sue the people who made the vaccine then we shouldn't get it.

1	if you haven't finished school how can you understand more than doctors
1/1	if you smoke ciggarets you should not worry about the covid vaccine
1/1	if you think ab any crazy virus or disease in the world, you do realize that people still get it to this day? it‚Äôs just not a majority of people anymore because we found vaccines and ways to treat it and make it more preventable than before

1/1	imagine risking people‚Äôs lives because you won‚Äôt take a vaccine. your the reason we‚Äôre in quarantine
1/0	imagine thinking the vaccine is bad
1/1	in my country vaccination is mandatory and free, it has nothing to do with earning money.
0/0	in my country. we are doing much better,. no need of the vaccine
0/0	in other words, they have no clue of what the side effects will be..
1/1	in short, YES GET VACCINATED, PLEASE
1/1	in the past vaccines have gave people certain reactions and even death in some cases . This is good news that these vaccines are going without a hitch .
1/1	individuals protecting themselves protects the herd in the long run, when enough are protected the virus has no where to go.
0/0	interesting experiment for Mrna..... Edits the genetics. Next step genetic diseases.
0/0	is there any liability for the vaccine makers if something goes wrong? If not, who benefits from selling us this vaccine and why?
0/0	is this even a vaccine ? MRNA ???? a vaccine has to be tested for atleast 5 to 10 yeasr before it can be administered to the masses to see the long term side effects. people are getting terminally sick and even dying from this mrna test. we humans are the Guinea pigs and we cant even take action or sue these vaccine makers for damages. yet still we are taking this experimental shittt..... we are surely brainwashed and we aren't thinking for ourselves. wake up people . we have hydroxy-chloroquin + zinc and even ivermectine which are cures yet still a vaccine agenda is being pushed. my god help us....
1/1	it helps to get back to normal life
1/1	it is better to take this vaccine
1/1	it is embarrassing how these anti-vaxxers put in danger their own child and the weakest, most in-need children who are not healthy enough to be vaccinated (herd-immunity) just for one fucking paper showing a CORRELATION, not a causation. i.e. pure speculation.
1/1	it is great to finally have the vaccines ready for the people
1/1	it is the greatest invention of all time
1/1	it is theONLY solution and we can only hope it works..
1/1	it is. the search for a covid-19 vaccine is one of the most well-researched and most well-funded, cooperative scientific endeavours of the modern era. even though we've been so divided this year, somehow humanity still found it in us to work together to find a cure for this awful disease that has killed hundreds of thousands in the us alone
0/0	it takes at most 10 days to recover from the vaccine?? You kidding me? Without vaccines it takes 10 days to recover.
1/1	it was my turn today to get inoculated against covid. got my first shot today. thank you
0/0	it will be interesting to see what the effects on these Guinea pigs will be!
0/0	it won't help us to not get it again, it will mean we will still have to wear the masks, and how come pep[;e ar gettomg bad things from it, and how come they have not had trials for it only a couple of hundred people and then it was people, not rats or guinea pigs and how come if this doesn't help us stop wearing the mask and it doesn't help us from not getting it again, how come they won't let us us Harliqoquin or other medicines that have been around for a long time that cure it if you catch it early? You people are just asking for trouble, you have to do your homework and check different things to make sure. I won't take it until I am sure what ever they have it has been tested. Also I believe we never had to do all this nonsense in the first place it just fit in perfectly for a pandemic that didn't need to be. They wanted people to listen to them and for us to be under their control so they could do what they are doing, ruining our wonderful country. The whole thing was just made up to keep us under control.
1/1	it's been 3 weeks getting second dose tomorrow. Please...do your part!!
0/0	it's designed to change our DNA unlike the common (safe) vaccines, they introduce a piece of the dead virus to help out body detect the virus
1/1	it's just the mRNA of the virus and that is an established practice already so it can be assumed to be decently safe
1/1	it's not like they have just started working on the vaccine from step 1, it has been studided before
0/0	its a persons right to refuse something they dont want in their body
0/0	its fake news!! Covid and vaccise is hoax
1/1	its funny how sceintis want to help people and yet people resist!
0/0	its makes your immune system weaker that‚Äôs the price you pay take vitamin A, D, C that‚Äôs all you need
0/0/0	its never been a "vaccine", it's genetic engineering.
1/1	its over 90 % safe just take it already!!
0/0	its reasonable to know that over 99 percent of people recover from covid.the vaccinations can't compete with those percentages.these shill doctor's need to go back and study mathematics.scientist information are a bunch of tested theories that are ever-changing.nothing in this life is guaranteed,but at least let us choose for ourselves what is best.the government is a beast entity that only cares about itself.
1/1	its sad to see how hard the scientists are working on the vaccine and how negative people are
0/0	its survival of the fittest, gtfo vaccines making men weak
0/0/0	i‚Äôm not scared about an allergic reaction i‚Äôm scared about the long term effects because we don‚Äôt know what they are
0/0/0/0	i‚Äôm not taking anything that changes my DNA smd
1/1	i‚Äôm pro vaccine all the way but if the conspiracy theorists are right and it turns out to kill us out or something, i‚Äôll be glad to be gone because then the only things left on this planet are those insufferable cunts
1/1	i‚Äôm pro vaccine, i‚Äôm pro (single) mask, and i still follow the guidelines/laws in the state i live in i dont go to ppls houses or to parties smh
1/1	just got my covid vaccine- astounded at the process, grateful for this moment.
1/1	just got my first vaccine today. No side effects so far. Thank you to all the scientists and researchers around the world for making the vaccine available this early and thank you for this channel for spreading the science. Yes, it‚Äôs definitely OK to be smart. Science rules!!!!
1/1	just got my second dose yesterday! God bless everyone, stay safe

0/0	keep them for your self
1/1	l take the vacine and there is no pain no side effects ..is just fine...l go for the second in 25 days ...
0/0	last time they released one of these it took years and years to get licensed and approved but they jus hit us with this in a year.
0/1	let them get vaccinated. it is not your body. I understand the vaccine concerns but no-one decides for another person. I am anti vaccine btw
1/1	let's go vaccines!
1/1	let's hope that these vaccines become available sooner than later. We really need to get this viral epidemic under control as quickly as possible‚Ä¶
0/0	let's see what a couple of months/years to see the real effects,good luck
1/1	let`s take this vaccine and see what happens.
1/1	lets hope they will work and we can all continue our lives!!
1/1	letting the virus spread is the better idea? take the damn vaccine
0/0	liars, people are waking up
1/1	like the humor but 66% is still generally effective once applied to the population, I think fear of vaccine rn is more than ever and stuff like this makes it harder to convince those who just see the headline and assume to actually get it. if anything any vaccine even 25% is useful or less because it removes a portion of the population from getting covid. you remove 25% of the US pop its 82m people immune :). understand most people know that it isnt an issue, but given recent events and the last few years, stats dont really mean much to most, they see a low number and use it as a weapon against whatever agenda. we should be heralding the effectiveness of any vaccine given the short period, especially one that can be transported to rural areas easier where the population more likely to be sceptical of it lives.
1/1	listen I don't know about all this american spiritual trippy stuff, but what I know is that if not enough people take the vaccine, then people will die. Alot of people will die. And for what? This is what happens when people forget history, forget diseases like polio and what it does to people. "But the vaccine might give side effects" yes? How many can be saved with it? Hundreds? Thousands? Hundreds of thousands? People need to care about others than themselves.
1/1	literally no poison or anything harmful in a vaccine. Russian roulette is what you play with covid, not the vaccine.
1/1	little scared but will still get the vaccine for the greater good save the old ones
0	load bs all to depopulate the human race,they are gene therapys if you have had the test up the nose you have already have the nanos in you
0/0	lol yeah lets change the DNA of all Humans, that can't possibly go wrong XD
0/0	lol you think this poison protects you?
1/1	love how everyone suddenly comes a professional in work that people have taken years to train for ü•¥ simple if you don't want the vaccine dont have it but also don't put others off from having it iv had mine am still here living and breathing and no side effects what so ever üëå
1/1	mRNA COVID vaccines are safe and effective. mRNA vaccines don't affect your personal genes or DNA. They do not contain a live virus. They cannot give you COVID
0/0	mRNA and DNA-based vaccines' side-effects in the short (6 months - 1 year), medium (2 to 3 years) and long (5+ years) term ARE COMPLETELY UNKNOWN TO SCIENCE. Thus those who consciously and voluntarily agreed to participate in such clinical trials and got those vaccines in their system have become lab rats indeed.
1/1	mRNA can't mutate because it's just messenger RNA. The reason why we have mutations is due to mistakes in the DNA duplication process when cells divide. Which is unrelated to the mRNA vaccine.
1/1	mRNA does not alter your genetics and this method of developing vaccines has been studied for over a decade now.
1/1	mRNA does not change your genes.
0/0	mRNA gene therapy taches our bodies to attack the 'protein S' which is already in our bodies, and is vital in the process of the reproduction. Wasn't it BG who wanted to fight overpopulation?
1/-1	mRNA is located outside the nucleus of your cells (in the cytoplasm where it will be translated into protein), so no, it will not alter your DNA or üß¨ code.
1/1	mRNA is precursor of protein. It‚Äôs as safe as protein or even safer. I would take it
1/0	mRNA not a trusted vaccine, be cautious whoever taking.. I will take adenovirus vaccine, which we can trust. Adenovirus vaccines are very successful.
0/0	mRNA technology has not been adequately or unequivacably proven. I do not want a chemical messing with my immune system.
0/0	mRNA technology has not been adequately or unequivacably proven. I do not want a chemical messing with my immune system. I'll boost my system naturally thank you
1/1	mRNA vaccine seems less likely to cause issues. It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt involve any live virus. Does not involve going into the nucleus itself at all. There is just less steps in the process in general.
0/0	mRNA vaccines are dangerous according to most Doctors. You did also not test them for long term damages so I say no thank you to the vaccine.
1/-1	mRNA vaccines have been studied before for flu, Zika, rabies, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). As soon as the necessary information about the virus that causes COVID-19 was available, scientists began designing the mRNA instructions for cells to build the unique spike protein into an mRNA vaccine

1/1	mRNA vaccines take advantage of this process by introducing the mRNA for an important protein from the virus that the vaccine is trying to protect against.

0/0	my mom said nobody elected Bill Gates to do anything and we ain't takin no vaccine from some shady ass nerd that wants to depopulate the planet.
0/0	my mom won‚Äôt allow me to take the vaccine
1/-1	my mother allmost died of it its real believe me
1/1	my neighbor took it and says she feel great
0/0	my nephew got vaccinated his immune system packed up and he had to have a bone marrow transplant
0/1	my son took a flu-shot once and now hes addicted to anime, never again
1/1	my vaccination card is on my fridge next to my dog‚Äôs puppy school diploma because both are great accomplishments
1/1	my younger sister had a kidney reaction to a baby vaccine, and as a result, she had to be hospitalized for a few weeks, and she will not be able to get that specific vaccine again, and others that may have the same outcome. however, my family and I are still on vaccines. if my sister cannot get this vaccine, she is at risk of having this disease, and to avoid this it is necessary that the people who have contact with her have the vaccine. Get vaccinated to protect yourself, and those who for health reasons cannot be vaccinated.
1/1	myself and loved ones will also get the vaccine!
1/1	natural selection. Self regulating problem, if you‚Äôre antivaxx. See you‚Ä¶
0/0	never in my life had the flu shot, what makes you think I‚Äôm going to take this
0/0	never. i will stick with raw garlic. you all can donate my dose
0/0	new broadcaster again doesnt ask the question - what are the long term health implications fwetr having it ..........Not one has asked that question (always a live or die dichotomoy) lazy, and not nuanced
0/0	no
0/0	no because Norwegian officials said 23 people had died in the country a short time after receiving their first dose of the vaccine.
0/0	no body should take this vacine
0/0	no need of vaccines
0/0/0	no one is sticking a needle in me not in a million years
0/0	no one needs this poison...
0/0	no thank you ! experiment for the government!
0/0	no thanks my immune system is working just fine ......im 62 and never get sick ...no flue shots either no flu ever......healthy living
0/0	no thanks, i don't want Bell's Palsy.
0/0	no thanks....i will let the guinea pigs do their duty and decide from there..
0/0	no to vaccines
0/0	no vaccination, no infection, no problems
0/0	no way in hell would I take any of those vaccines... I'll take my 99% chance of survival with the covid. Those odds are good to me.
0/0	no. it can not. with the rate this is mutating, there is no way a vaccine is going to do anything. there are really only two ways to get a handle on this. Complete shut down, or go back to NORMAL and let it run its course. If everyone gets it, and beats strain a, it wont have as much of a chance to mutate before it can be destroyed by our immune systems. Deaths to date are STILL within normal yearly flu deaths. So choose. Hide from the bogyman that sees you in the corner, or pull up your big person pants and get too work. '
1/1	nobody wants this stupid bullshit just give us the vaccine
0/0	nobody with a brain cell in there head is going take that vaccine
0/0	none of them prevent transmission so quite a dangerous path to go down
1/1	not a huge fan of Biden either, but fortunately he won‚Äôt support a vaccine mandate. Medical freedom still exists and if you don‚Äôt want to get the vaccine, then don‚Äôt, but scientific evidence is still going to be there to support why you should consider getting it.
0/0	not a single person I know trust the vaccine or are willing to take it.
0/1	not every vaccine had side effects.. at least China's does not have according to them.... CHINA NO.1!!!!
0/0	not everyone wants the vaccine
0/0	not getting it!! I had Covid I survived it...my rheumatologist suggested I still get the injection I‚Äôm not getting it
0/0	not safe enough for me to take.
0/0	not taking any more vaccines....I no longer trust the manufacturers.
0/0	not the way it was tested, dangerous
0/0/0	nothing is safe from you or gates.
0/0	nterview mothers who have had normal, healthy children who suddenly regress or cannot stop screaming in pain after they were vaccinated. I know a child damaged by vaccines. She could walk and talk but after a doctors visit she lost all her abilities to walk and speak. Find out how many families the government has compensated for the damage done by vaccines. If they weren‚Äôt harming people then why would they be compensated?
0/0	of course they dont want your killshot
1/0/1	of friggin course your sources are from 4chan, anti-vaxxers don‚Äôt have ANY credible sources
1/1	often a single dose is enough to stimulate long-term protection
1/-1	ok so my question is this. So they arent actually using covid19 in the vaccines?
1/1	okay, this sounds safe
1/1	omg although I missed the early squad. I have been receiving so many requests from friends and family regarding the safety of covid vaccines. This video eases my burden of explaining and addresses all the doubts one might have.
1/1	one would be lucky to even get an appt for the vaccine let alone having a choice in which one...
0/0	only a fool would take any of these vaccines..
0/0	only stupid people will agree to vaccine themselves like pigsüòÆ
0/0	only the dumbest sheeple will take this vaccine or any vaccine for that matter.
1/1	only way to get rid of this shit is to take vaccine
0/0	other times cleaning personnel are completely ignored.And when it's about vaccination they are priority? How can people not know they are completely using people as test subject? If the vaccine was properly researched and safe all these politicians would have recieved vaccination before any one else.
1/1	people CAN refuse it and should refuse it if they have concerns. im an RN in a covid ICU and i happen to have MS- for me, the risk of getting covid and having long term effects was greater than my concern about the vaccine. i had the vaccine last week and had no side effects other than an extremely sore arm for about a day. but i support people making decisions they are comfortable with.
1/1	people acting smarter than trained physicians lmaoo we are doomed as a species
1/0	people also survived a million years without eyeglasses. So what, you're not gonna wear em if you have bad eyesight?
1/1	people always insist to stand against science, they only appricate it after years
0/0	people are hesitant to blindly trust something with unproven long term complications when it‚Äôs their life on the line, people are allowed to be skeptical, you don‚Äôt have any high ground over them
1/-1	people do not die without a Formula One car, but not without a vaccine, do they?
1/1	people don't deserve science, all those anti vacciners shall not be allowed to take it
0/1	people on the antivaccine side tend to make bold claims but no evidence to back it up.
0/0	people shouldn't be taking vaccines for a virus that isn't dangerous.
1/1	people still dont understand that it doesnt take long to create vaccine now‚Ä¶ like in the old days when the flu first came out
1/1	people were willing to participate in clinical trials which was huge in getting things moving right on this vaccine!
0/1	perhaps you guys can take the vaccine yourselves, and do a daily vlog showing your results. Cheers.
0/1	please continue with the testing and ensure it's safe before distribution
1/1	please take the vaccine ...it gives you an active immunity... and this is to a good percentage protective! However it doesn‚Äôt mean you won‚Äôt get covid anymore..you will just be stronger to fight it!!
1/1	received the Moderna vaccine 3 days ago. I feel fine so far.
0/0	remember ‚Äúi am legend‚Äù yeah, me too
0/1	reports emerging from Norway indicate that at least twenty three people have died after taking the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, yet the government regulator has said they don‚Äôt see anything alarming in the cases‚Ä¶
0/0	rushed to market mRNA vaccines may do more harm than good.
0/0	sad that people have to get this poison
1/1	sadly people are dumb enough to do not take it
0	same, ill wait until at least 10 millions beta test it
0/0	say no to poison
1/1	science have always helped human race, yet people don‚Äôt beilive in it
0/1/1/0	scientists who developed these vaccines are also speedrunners in their spare time confirmed
1/-1	screeching ahead on vaccinating population will be opening up to drive economy, ship excess vaccine to its friends, not EU commission! Travel from eu will be controlled as infection rates increase in Europe from the ever increasing variants. Sadly..AZ Oxford vaccine given to help Europe, EU. at cost price! The only answer, sadly the EU Commission fail the people of Europe
0/0	search results from the vaers database 'found 329 cases where vaccine targets covid-19 and patient died'.. No vaccine please
0/0	she knows better. she ain't getting it.......No way will I put my trust in the corrupt Pharmaceutical Companies, or the CDC , who is a vaccine company . I would be safer trusting the Mafia.
1/1	sheeple who don‚Äôt vaccinate gonna die and take you along with them smh
1/1	shot 2 done right. Feel this one a little more than first shot but I was normal and will hopefully be perfect
1/-1	should have vaccinated your mom else you wouldnt have been born retarded
0/0/0	side effects, just like covid symptoms hahaha.
0/0	smells like a whole lotta BS to me.... no thanks.
1/1	so amazing! Well done to everyone who has worked tirelessly on this vaccine.
1/1	so excited to see a vaccine in the works! let's hope that this will help get everything back to normal sooner
0/0	so genetically modified humans?
0/0	so happy there's so many willing pro-Vs out there who trust big pharma with their own lives. so we don't have to.
0/0	so vaccines simply reduce the severity of the symptoms. ok. so then give it to those that are at the highest risk of dying from it right? ohhh never mind because the vaccine is also deadly to the "most frailest" aka the people at highest risk of dying from the virus... one is avoidable and the other authoritarian anti human rights assholes want to make mandatory. listen if any of you want to be literal lab rats that take the vaccine and die from it or maybe not knowing the vaccine makers have been given special protections against being held liable because of the known risks associated with such careless implementation then so be it but dont go forcing it on everyone else. if they told you the truth you would not take the vaccine but no they baby you and sugar coat it to make you feel like absolutely nothing can go wrong if you take it. it should be required by law that you know and understand the risks and why those risks exist and then you should have the ability to decide whether or not if you want to take those risks. i for one standing a better chance of winning the lottery than dying of covid would much rather just get covid than to take a new vaccine that has little to no testing and a rushed development cycle. when it comes to things liek the flu shot sure because we have had decades to do research and development for it but some thing like covid? hell no. a virus that of which not a single person on this planet had a physical sample of the virus for the first several months of the pandemic per the CDC and has mutated at least 3 times within a single year and you expect me to think its irrational not to get the rushed vaccine without question? craziness.
0/0	so why does this vaccine change your RNA and DNA ?I no folks that have died from the vaccine with no health conditions?
1/0	so y'all care about long term effects of the vaccine but not covid?
1/1	some of you are thick as hell. 89% is so much higher than the current 0% we‚Äôve had for a year. Try counting to 89 and be more mindful in how long that takes compared to counting to one. Also, Be bloody grateful you‚Äôre still here and have even been able to see a vaccine develop - some people haven‚Äôt been so lucky!!!
0/0	sorry it doesn‚Äôt work
0/0	stick this vaccine up into your own ass you crazy NWO
1/-1	still can't believe that within a year - mass vaccination is possible!!
1/1	still would go for covaxin any day!
1	stop being dumb ppl, just take it already
0/0	stop persuading people to take something unknown and hasn‚Äôt been tested long term!
1/1	strong protection as vaccine mimics the natural infection process
0/0	swedes have learned from experience to not take any new vaccine. we will gladly wait to see what the effects are to avoid a repeat of the swine flu vaccine which ended up being statistically more dangerous than the swine flu were, not even close.
1/1	take polio shots, never get polio.
1/1	take the Moderna one. It's safer.
0/0	take your Vax and shove it as hard as humanly possible up your A$$

1/1	thankful for these people who are willing to help the process for the betterment of the world. You guys are warriors!!!
1/1	thanks a lot for the clear explanation. So is the vaccine safe and effective.
0/0	that means personal responsibility which is something people find offensive. I'd rather be responsible for myself than to trust someone else- or a doctor or gov't
0/0	that vaccine isn't going anywhere in my body, let everybody else be guinea pigs..
0/0	that vaccines clearly killing people and yall expect ppl to get it
0/0/0	thats like saying- shoot me in the head first- and i will take notes afterward...
1/1	the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine already had its 3rd trial which supports its positive results elsewhere in the World
1/1	the UK, Canada and now the US are authorizing the use of the Pfizer vaccine! if it is OK for them why not us? What on earth are the EMA doing.....! perhaps the UK did do the right thing by authorizing the vaccine on their own and forgetting about the dumb solidarity of EU's licensing programme....!
1/1	the anti vax people. Simply ridiculous.
1/1/1	the antivaccines people are that type of people who said "i don t know" if they re ask for their allergies
1/1	the best thing people can do, is stop watching the "news"..
0/-1	the best way to cure covid 19 is to stop watching tv
1/1	the big problem is the lake of trust in poletics and the unfaer system. Thats al
1/1	the country needs more vaccines and we need them fast.. We are all wanting to do them.!!
0/0	the deaths are from the vaccines are rising
0/0	the drug companies have no liability should anything go wrong.
0/-1	the end is near the end is near!!!
1/1	the expectation in government is that for the next few years people will need regular booster jabs to protect against new variants of covid, as with the flu jab
1/1	the first dose is fairly effective and will prevent most from dying
0/0	the flu vaccine brings out the flu so wouldn't the covid-19 vaccine bring out covid-19 in someone bc that's why i never get a flu shot!!
0/-1	the good news is my kid does not have small pox. the bad news is he bangs his head into the wall all day. and can't talk.
0/0	the government controls the vaccines therefore they re all bad
0/0	the govt wants to put their crap in me, no way that‚Äôs happening
0/0	the human body is 99.997 effective, why would i take some rushed illgates poison ?
1/1	the last administration hadn't set up any distribution plans and this one is trying to get caught up. He's only had 2 weeks.
1/1	the list of ingredients for Moderna/Pfizer are incredibly simple, and none of them concerned me as a pharmacist
0/0	the long term side effects of these vaccines wont be realized until 3-5 yrs. after taking them. I am, not gonna take it‚Ä¶
1/1	the mRNA in the vaccine never enters the nucleus of the cell because it doesn‚Äôt have the necessary signal. But, even if it did, mRNA would need to be converted into DNA via an enzyme the vaccine doesn‚Äôt possess. Thus it is indeed safe!
0/1	the main stream media already said it would take a miracle for a vaccine that be out this early. So no I'm not gonna take one.
1/-1	the only person that should't the vaccine is that one guy on gta that's level 1,000 or higher
1/1	the only side effect i had from the covid vaccine was all the bad dreams i had last night
1/1	the only way to the freedom is taking this vaccine‚Äô
1/0	the problem with must of you is that you will gladly drink, eat, snore and inject poisons in your body, your precious temple........you must hate yourself so much and you rather believe in the 'devil'
1/1	the risks from taking vaccines are astronomically lower than the risks from the diseases the vaccines
1/0	the risks of getting covid outweigh the risks of the vaccine
1/1	the risks of getting vaccinated are very very low but the risks of not getting vaccinated are very high.
1/1	the risks of getting vaccinated are very very low but the risks of not getting vaccinated are very high. if enough people are vaccinated then the anti vaxxers will be fine because of herd immunity but if no one gets vaccinated, they will all be seriously ill and die at a younger age.
1/-1	the salt in his voice when he mentioned antivax was enough to cure a pig
1/1	the side effects are minimal and no one has died from the vaccine while many people have died from covid. which is why you need to get vaccines on a schedule? Not just this Covid one. But every vaccine. It‚Äôs the same reason you need to get your flu shot yearly. To make sure that you‚Äôre effectively protected
1/1	the side effects are still better then getting covid
0/0	the side effects are worse then covid
0/0/0	the thing Im mostly amazed with is people thinking the government cares about them. A relative of mine just died the day after she got vaccine. THIS IS TRUE!
1/-1	the thoughts of these scientists doing actual productive research to the betterment of humankind.... and then there's tictok - ers like charlie & bella, earning as much, if not more.... just makes me wonder tf is wrong with the world.
0/0	the va$$ines are killing people
0/0	the vaccination is more dangerous than the disease. We know the survival rate for COVID-19 and it is not deadly enough to warrant taking a rushed and untested vaccine in which there may be very negative long term consequences
0/1	the vaccine is a gift from God, the sooner you get vaccinated, the sooner you meet him
0/0	the vaccine is killing so many fragile, elderly. that should frighten everyone
0/1	the vaccine is made by man and man is not perfect. how can we expect that it will be perfect and free of any side effects
0/0	the vaccine is more deadly than theh covid itself.
1/1	the vaccine is our best line of defense against this awful pandemic.
0/0	the vaccine is safe it might just kill you.
0/0	the vaccine literally almost killed my uncle.
1/1	the vaccine means that a new hope is coming that thie nightmare might end and we might get back to our normal life...
1/1	the vaccines can WORK‚Ä¶they are working for so many other disease..now also for the virus!!
1/0	the whole anti-vaxxer movement is basically a bunch of peoole saying "i can medicine better than doctors"
0/-1	there has never been any successful vaccine for coronaviruses in humans due to a problem typical of coronavirus vaccine development called antibody dependent enhancement or ADE
0/0	there hasn't been enough time to say " no long term side effects".
0/0	there is no covid we don't need a vaccine
1/1	there is no need to be afraid from the vaccine. Everything gonna be alright
1/1	there is no reason not to vaccinate your kids
0/0	there was not yet enough evidence from vaccine trials "to be confident that it's going to prevent people from actually getting the infection and therefore being able to pass it on
1/1	these anti vaccine people dont see the bigger picture.
1/1	they are a variety of vaccines based on 10 year old or even 50 year old technology (based on an idea from the 1700s). And they have been tested. On thousands of people. And approved by multiple health authorities.
0/0/0/0	they can shove that vaccine where the sun dont shine.... i refuse to take anything they have to offer
1/0	they had a reaction but not too nasty but the BBC think better run a scare story so the Twitter fools can rant.
0/0	they have been vaccinating for however long and yet the flu returns year after year in new variants. my family stopped taking the flu shots and we stopped getting the flu every year. so i am talking from personal experience. I say NO to this covid19 vaccine and that is my personal choice. We still have freedom of choice right?
1/1	they have not been. The information is readily available. Unfortunately, most people don't do any actual research because it takes time. If they did they would understand that there have been no deaths attributed to the vaccines. As for injuries, all side effects are listed and resolved but this information isn't looked for either.
0/0	they will establish a new world order with the vaccines
1/1	they work they work they work they work!!!!! Do the vaccines asap‚Ä¶
0/0/0/0	they've been giving vaccinations for decades, and not one has been successful to any great percentage...count me out...I'll rely on God and my natural defenses.
0/0	they‚Äôd also be gambling by getting the vaccines. Vaccines have been known to cause SIDS, epilepsy and other serious conditions or death. They‚Äôre both risky.
0	this a scam either there is no syrum in the vaccine or the oil enters the syringe do not trust what it has shown you without having formal proof
1/1	this can save millions of lives
1/1	this is amazing
1/0	this is amezing wwery gratefull for this good explanation
0/1	this is an untried new type of RNA Vaccine...paints any kind of Vaccine reluctance as 'anti-vax' in its patently disgusting biased non - journalism.
0/0/0	this is good info, i'll pass on the vaccine. my body my choice right?
1/-1	this is interesting
1/1	this is so helpful tbh. I'm going to get the vaccine when they have one in our town.
1/1	this is so sad can we have vaccine parties
1/-1	this is where the eu are slow again the uk have already ordered vaccines for 2022 and 2025
0/0	this poison so called vaccine doesnt stop you catching this flu let alone stopping you from spreading it" best result they say ??? is that it softens the side effects from this flu" and guess what many new strains are being reported worldwide which will make it completly useless " jab on brainless sheep"
0/0	this vaccine brought to you by big pharma, pls give us your money we will use it to make more viruses thanks
1/1	this vaccine is safe.
0/0	this vaccine my have had a lot of tests But not the test of time
0/0	this whole vaccine trail just feels like the start of every zombie movie.
1/1	those doctors didn't go through 10+ years of school to have someone who makes clothes tell them about 50% of their course material. Girl, they know it's safe-ish better than having your child dead-ish.

1/1	uhhhhh they will be the ones alive you idiot.
0	uk gov has to wind down covid figures just so sheep believe that vaccine working when its probably contributing to more side effects or deaths.Whos betting that they continue this and tease coming out of lockdown and then at last moment reveal some cooked up new mutant variant.
1/1	upon receiving my second dose of the covid vaccine today, i thanked my nurse for all of her service. she said it was her honor and she thanked me for my service in return

0/0	vaccination makes you gay, just like it did to your parents
1/1	vaccinations made me socialize again
1/1	vaccine efficacy all I have to say is that having had mild to moderate covid (which was brutal) I'd very happily be jagged in the arm with something that didn't protect much against that in the future but still did a fair bit to stop me from ending up in hospital or dying
1/1	vaccine is good!
1/1	vaccine is here already and it‚Äôs rolling great.

0/0	viruses have always been with us, and our immune system should fight it without any of those rna nano super safe vaccine
1/1	wait until there's another polio outbreak in US, then those anti-vaxxers might shut up
0/0	wake up do your own research don't rely on a bunch of corrupt 'experts' that have their heads buried in an Aldi bag. As Craig kelly demonstrated covid 19 can be treated with ivermectin, there is a 99% recovery rate. the real issue here is Gates invested millions into vaccines and is determined to push it at all costs.

1/1	we need the vaccine, to prevent ourselves from the virus because unlike the influenza, this one is more fatal
1/0	we need to know with any drugs it has side effects
1/1	we relied heavily on previous vaccine research to develop it, including research on other coronaviruses like SARS and MERS making it completely reliable!
1/1	we tried to mitigate to keep activities open, as we can't afford to close them anymore, and hoping in vaccines. Covid Zero just can't be applied here (In my opinion)
1/1	we will get vaccinated as soon as we can to be able to travel and visit my family without infecting them.

0/0	who will be crazy enough to take an experimental vaccine??
1/-1	why are there so many dislikes
0/0	why are they pushing it as a "vaccine" when it clearly isn't? This one is gene therapy, not a vaccine as such. The public wouldn't take it up if it was marketed as what it actually is. It's false representation & very misleading, so obviously there's another agenda here.
0/0	why aren‚Äôt you saying how many people died right after getting the vaccine ? since you know it causes soreness ? i‚Äôm sure you heard how norway is advising no one to take this nano particle vaccine
0/0	why do vaccine manufacturers lobby for legal immunity from prosecution for damages if their products are so "evidently" safe?'
0/1	why everybody turn blind eye that this count as biological weapon ?
0/0	why in the world would we trust them injecting ANYTHING into our veins??
1/1	why is everyone so scared to take it?
1/1	why people can't just appricate science, if they don‚Äôt want take it then don‚Äôt why need to be so negative
0/0	why take vaccine with 95% protection, when recovery rate is about 98% from the disease?
0/0	why take vaccines when you can have Jesus
1/1	why wasn't it already at top production
0/0/1/0	why we need to take vaccine if the virus has 99.9% survival rate ??
0/0	why would a nation inject it's entire military forces with this experimental technology? don't airline pilots have to eat different meals to avoid food poisoning?
0/0	why would anyone get vaccinated with a survival rate over 95%? let's not forget how the china flu was used to rig an election.
1/1	why would anyone go to the trouble and expense of putting chips (for purposes other than stated) in millions upon millions of vaccines when all your information is already being tracked by your cellphone?
0/0	why would we take something if "we don't know the effects"
0/0	why would you get vaccinated if you already had it
1/1	why yes I support a healthy physique and scientific research on vaccines, how did you know?
1/1	why??????what's wrong with vaccines?????
1/1	will be getting mine soon, need to protect not only myself but my children and grandchildren. Side affects seem small compared to risk of death.
1/1	will definitely be taking that vaccine!
1/1	will help to break the chain of transmission of COVID-19
0/-1	will people actually ever get vaccinated?
1	with the reports around what even asymptomatic COVID could do to a healthy set of lungs in the long term vaccination is far preferable to mild to moderate
1/1	with the vaccine here, I hope things will get better.
0/1	woah this is all so cool! It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s important to be safe and reaserch the vaccines before you get them of course, but this video seems really interesting! I see your getting a lot of comments trashing the science and depending on conspiracy, so i just want to say thank you for the time and effort for making this! i enjoyed it :)
1/0	work for a major healthcare provider and even then they‚Äôll only provide UPTO for going to get it. Some of my coworkers are even holding off getting the vaccine for that very reason.
0/0	would rather die of covid then be injected by retard juice
0/0	would seriously want to stay away from this vaccine for a few years because this technology of developing vaccine is never been used before.
1/1	would you rather your grandma die than take vaccine??
0/0	wouldn't take it if my life depended on it. Because it doesn't.
0/1	wow they've got rollercoasters there. Thats a really smart way of attracting people to get vaccinated. A shot and a ride
1/1	wow this is good news for UK I hope the world can go back to normal soon and this vaccine can save us from this monster virus
0/-1	wow wasted my time... never watching ABC again.
0/1	wow! i cant believe they are refusing medical treatment if you don't get a covid vaccine! That is insane they are doing that. How is that legal i can't wrap my head around that being legal.
1/1	wow.. science is wonderful.. imagine how many disciplines it takes to build all those stuff... I feel like a dot of dust, or probably a mere electron now :D
1/1	y'all also realize people experience different things??so if one person reacts negatively that doesn't mean YOU will.
1/1	y'all eating McDonald's and ramen noodles on a daily while drinking cola and think a vaccine is unsafe
1/0	y'all ever flex on non-vaxxed kids by being alive
1/1	y'all will consume drugs you got from who knows where yet you won't take a vaccine.. Like ok that makes sense
0/0	ya'll haven't found the cure for Hiv / Aids in all these years but now ya'll magically have the cure for covid in under a year yea im good on the lies

1/1	yay Vaccine
1/1	ye your right. Dude we should support this anti vaxxers. Soon overpopulation won't be a problem and people with brain cells will be the people that live on this planet.
0/0	yea ill, get some nature, sun, eat healthy and exercise. No vaccines for me, they not putting nothing in me.
0/0	yeah idc how "safe" the vaccine is, im not taking it
0/0	yeah im not taking that bud

0/1	yep then we end up like i am legend
0/0	yes hard to believe because the flu shot made me really sick for 6 weeks why i never do it again this be no different
1/1	yes i do, because vaccinating is a good thing in almost every way and i don't tend to believe conspiracies either
1/1	yes if it means we can get back to life again, I'm all for it.
0/0	yes vaccines like the antivirus update of BGates. We commoners will take chances and leave vaccines to rich ones.
1/-1	yes! All women in medicine should be celebrated
1/1	yes, i got the vaccine. & yes, i‚Äôm getting my vaccination card laminated & putting it in my passport case.
1/1	yes, the vaccine cannot stop the virus from entering our bodies, but the great benefit comes from the previous "training" our immune system undergoes when presented with the antigen contained in the vaccine.
1/1	yes. im so excited. please lets give everyone the shot so we can finally get on with our lives
1/-1	yet, no evidence, to prove the point you're making, stop being married to your conspiracy theories with no evidence.
1	you are alive today due to vaccination.
1/1	you asked: Why take the vaccine if you're not completely protected? Because it takes time to become immune, as well as a booster shot to reach 95% effectiveness. Some people also have weaker or compromised immune system responses and can only be protected by herd immunity. We would need about 70% of the population to be vaccinated before we can accomplish that. In the meantime, we'll still need to wear masks and physically distance.
0/0	you can take your vaccine and shove it up your corrupt arse. keep your needles away.
0/0	you know that vax is not really a cool thing its causes autism
1/1	you protect yourself and others
0/0	you will get a shot every other month.. ??? that's not a vac.. that's a drug
1/1	your chances of getting infected after a vaccine are lower than so-called "natural immunity"

1/-1	‚Äôm willing to get a vaccine when it‚Äôs my turn, but as a healthy adult, it says there are 268.7 million people ahead of me.
1/1	‚ÄúAn outbreak anywhere is an outbreak everywhere‚Äù - well not if my country is vaccinated already because we prioritized our own citizens. The US has been the hardest hit country anyways, even in a global sense we should be prioritized.

0/0	‚ÄúNo evidence (now)‚Äù does not mean there will not be problem later. Pfizer CEO himself does not want to take his own vaccine totally does not show confidence in it!

0/0	üåàA healthy man doesn't need to be vaccinated of any covid 19 vaccine because covid 19 is not harmful for everyone and the vaccine is not a solution because covid 19 mutilated itself with time second thing, can a vaccine treat body inflammation or pneumonia? answer is no! and the third thing is. If covid 19 is so fatal it would have killed every affected patient. And next thing why the death ratio is different through out the world . it is patient body's overwhelming action on corona that makes the situation worst and because of this patient's body get inflamed and later he faces septicemia and it is a cause of death. In some cases the patient faces some heart and kidney related problems. and the thing is responsible for this, it is inflammation because inflammation damages patient's respiratory system and it is the reason for whole crisis. Because in lack of oxygen the patient's body system get destroyed and septicemia make the situation dreadful . because of it patient's body lose it's capability to kill the virus. I make you sure that The patient's body has capability to fight against covid 19 no matter what type of virus is that. but it needs time and the patient has to avoid inflammation . and it is the way the patient can avoid inflammation till the body produces antibodies against the virus. Believe or not we can stop our body inflammation by controlling our eating habits it is possible. I am a patient of pneumonia myself and I was fed up of allopathic treatment but I followed some aurvedic instructions and some research was done by myself , today I am hundred percent healthy. I don't take a single pill to treat pneumonia because I don't face it since last two years. There is no possible vaccine for corona and only Ayurveda can save from this mysterious virus. millions of experimets have been carried out no result. If someone gets affected with covid 19 he should eat only the following things. if a corona patient eats the following things his body would not produce mucus and he is safe - the things are - wheat, gram(chana) , white sugar, milk ( milk from animals) and all products made from milk , salt, red chili, mutton, chicken, fish, mustered oil, tea, masoor dal(peagion food ) ,green leaves but not Cobbage, remember all this products mustn't be contaminated and they must be pure. if the patient eat these things and don't eat enything else and follows these instructions strictly. it is nothing but common cold. it takes 15 to 18 days because the patient has already eaten something that his body would take 15 days to stop producing mucus. If someone get affected with covid 19 he must consume the said foods because this thing takes 15 to 16 days and if someone delays to apply this thing. The situation would be out of control so apply this thing immediately and the patient must wash his nose with hot water. I mean warm water and inhale hot water thrice a day by his nose and he shouldn't mix the cold water into the hot water to get the temperature down because if he does so. I don't know why but the result will be zero. so to get the temperature down either the patient can pour the water or he should wait for some time. I think Patient nose is a heaven for the virus because neither body's action nor medicine works there the patient must wash his nose. how, it is on himself because virus enter into the lungs from here and the patient get affected again and again. it is my personal experience and please have a trust on it.the patient mustn't eat the fruits neither a single bite and others vegetables besides green leaf because fruits and vegetables are the main source or cause to makes our body producing mucus. It means if the patient follows the said instructions his body never get inflammation and a healthy person doesn't need to follow this formula. It is for those who are under threat and either they have a history of pneumonia or they are in their old ages and patients of diabetes or at high risk. besides them no need to worry it is only common cold for a healthy person nothing more. I am a patient of pneumonia and I have been researching on pneumonia for last 18 years. if the patient trusts this thing. and applying this thing. he never need a vantilater and he never going to face any worst or a death. do you know why the death ratio is less in poor countries. it is the reason. the poor people don't eat fruits and vegetables as much compare to the richer and mostly the rich people have been dying with corona. a six month old child never faces pneumonia because he fed only its mother's milk. a wild animal never face pneumonia because he never eats another feed besides green leaves, a man never faces pneumonia if he eats the said things. and if you get over with it once you needn't to worry at all( if you are not a patient of pneumonia). friends pneumonia made my body too sensitive. so I discovered this thing. it took me 18 to 20 years to sort out these things. I have most sensitive body because if I eat an orange I get a body pain immediately and if I eat rice continously for four and five days I get cold that turns itself into pneumonia after one or two days I have faced corona and it took me 16 days To get rid of it and it was like a some different kind of cold for me i lost my appetite, smell and test. I became weak but I saved my life because I am on the said diet already but if I won't have known this thing I would be a dead man yet for sure with this therapy you can cure gangrene, septicemia or such wounds that not have been getting cured for long time. It takes fifteen to eighteen days to get the results starting. (A healthy person must avoid fruits and vegetables during the infection. and an under threat person must eat the said foods during the infection) Note: vitamin c daily value is different for different people. a patient of pneumonia needs very little amount of vitamin c and green leaves like spinach and lettuce can full fill this need perfectly.
