0	When a vaccine is safe and effective you don‚Äôt need to promote it no?
1	Everybody that does not take the vaccine will die
0	Well I wont b takin vaccine coz i dont trust it
0	I have sickle cell anemia. I'm not taking the vaccine until they do study on people like me. I'm on vitamin D3 and liquid vitamin A - zink. My diet is all organic I don't eat fast food, I cook my meals.
1	I‚Äôm in the moderna clinical trial, so feel free to ask any Q about the vaccine.
1	I just got my 2nd Dose today! Let‚Äôs go
0	I am 24 and healthy going to wait to take it in case there are long term problems
0	No way, i will only take it after 2 years. It is a rush job.....
0	The flu shot made me sick last time I got one. No vaccines for me.
0	I‚Äôm glad that they didn‚Äôt make it mandatory. No vaccins for us
0	If enough sheeple get the vaccine then that means I won't have to.
1	As soon as I can, I will be vaccinated. The only way to deal with this pandemic right now. Thank you for your engagement
1	Nursing home I work at has had zero cases among staff or residents since the first round of vaccines. Just got our second round last week as well. Morale is way up and the results have caused some vaccine doubters among the staff to sign up for the next vaccine round in two weeks. Definitely light at the end of the tunnel
0	At what month or year after taking a vaccine  for Covid do you become sterile or your health deteriorates until death?   And by then nobody will question or even think about you being sterile or have died because of the vaccine you took a few months or years ago.   The pushers of the vaccines response?   In public, "we didnt know"   In private, "Mission accomplished"
1	I wish 7 billion were waiting for the vaccine. Smh anti vaxxers
0	I will NEVER take it, if you are vaccinated you are supposedly safe, so mind your business.
0	If I can't hold someone accountable for a product that can hurt me then I don't have to take it period dot.
1	Thanks UNICEF for your lovely effort to save the life of the universe
1	It‚Äôs weird how when a virus has a 3% chance of death, people go ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs not that serious, the chance of you dying is only 3% why you taking it so seriously?‚Äù But when a vaccine has a 5% chance of either not working or has adverse side effects (not even a 5% chance of death, just side effects) people go ‚ÄúNO THE VACCINE BAD!! TOO DANGEROUS! I DONT TRUST IT!‚Äù
0	Id rather catch the virus with a 98% survival rate then get that poison vaccine
0	We don't want yur evil vaccines
0	Relatively new, experimental..... No, thanks, but no....
1	I‚Äôd like to see the venn diagram of C19 vaccine hesitancy and Trump support.
0	How about the deaths in Norway after vaccine?
0	We simply don't know about long term effects. There hasn't been enough time
1	I'm going to take it. I just want myself and family to be safe and alive, all that matters at this point.
1	Love this. Let's keep it up!
1	I‚Äôm willing to take the minute it is available so that I can live a normal life soon and hopefully trigger others in my circle to follow suit.
0	No serious effects? Tell that to Hank Aaron.... oh wait... he's dead 2 days after taking the vaccine.
0	It's not a vaccine. It cannot be mandated. The immune system is more effective than any vaccine.. with no side effects. Healthy people are healthy people. They need no treatment. And get a better test as the PCR is not a valid diagnostic tool, according to the man who created it.
1	Sounds like a great vaccine I am excited about it. Since my children have asthma problems.
0	Did they actually made a pre fase testing on animals? Did they ever isolated the virus so that they can use RNA ie DNA? How do you explain so many sudden deaths after the vaccine? It seams that according to that those vaccines shouldn't pass the phase one. And last and not the least: is it possible that they lied about those results you are mentioning?
0	It's poison. Wake up America. I don't get any vaccinations and neither do my kids and we're are fine. They put stuff that kills you slowly
1	I mean talking about side effects just look at the ones for paracetamol which is effectively used in most of the world as far as I know
0	Don't take vaccines coz overpopulation is a problem.
0	Corona is fake and I won't be vaccinated
0	They like to tell us the reason for something is one thing when it really exists for a totally different reason. Like they say abortion gives women a choice but it‚Äôs really depopulation
1	1000000% the doctors nurses and health workers should be priority to vaccination without them we would fail against covid !
0	No thank you
1	Everyone who take the vaccine trails are HERO. Stay strong!
0	More doses of death juice in the vial. Problem solved. This guy's a genius!
1	Thank you so much for this video I'll be sleeping better tonight
0	I am NOT taking any vaccines related to Covid-19. As a matter of fact, I am not taking any more vaccines for as long as i am alive.
0	My question is, how is it acceptable that the virus vaccine had been discovered immediately and is not a threat to human life while HIV aids had been there for decades without a vaccine to immune rhe human body form HIV? ü§¶‚ôÄÔ∏èFear the evil behind such vaccine. ‚õî‚ùå

They have been driven into a state of morbid fear (of absolutely nothing) to the point where they will stand in line, in the middle of the night, to get injected with a human pesticide containing an IGR, just so this poison doesn't go bad. Pure Darwin at work here. These pussified sheep will make the ultimate contribution to the gene pool. They'll remove themselves from it.
1	#iamhere  to  thank  for sharing this information, in this difficult moment we are living, a complete and correct communication is essential. Vaccines have always helped humanity and will do so even now.
1	Its fine, let those anti vaxxers catch the whooping cough and see how they like it lol
0	Sorry no vaccines here for me and my family not happening were passing on it won't be no side affects here were not taking it üëç
1	Thank you for this! Going to share! Dr Seema perfectly articulates what I explained to my family and friends who naturally have reservations about the vaccine.
0	I dont trust vaccines rushed, people will die regardless of what it offers.
1	My cousin is antivax and has had 3 children. All of them have autism.
0	I agree. Usually clinical trials take at least 9 years to gather robust safety data (observation for side effects) in a variety of various patient groups (elderly, children, pregnant women, patients with specific health conditions, etc.), but this vaccine as been rushed through by the health authorities and granted marketing authorisation (permission to be administered to patients) at such a breakneck speed, it is of a grave concern. That is why we do not need a similar situation as was seen in thalidomide.
1	"No amount of evidence will ever persuade an idiot‚Äù
1	Ugh I‚Äôm so pumped for the vaccine even though I despise getting stabbed by a needle.
1	Man, my friends and I cant wait to all get together for a post vaccination party.
0	I find it very amusing at the fact in every picture of health care workers getting vaccinated, we do not see the actual needle nor it going in. It has been revealed on numerous occasions, with the exact same discrepancies as this example. Propaganda at its finest.   all you want with those paid smiles, but you cannot deny nor hide the truth
0	NOOOOOO THANK YOU!!!!!!
1	ALL need to take it in order to save lives!!!!
1	And yet my mother is still convinced the vaccines are actively killing otherwise completely healthy people. I can‚Äôt fucking wait to get vaccinated and rub it in her face
1	So far all my grandparents, my mother in law, my step dad, 2 clinically vulnerable friends and my aunt and uncle have had the jab, which now is far more people than I know who‚Äôve had covid. To me that feels like we‚Äôre slowly winning.
1	Phizer. Just sore arm
0	If they offer the Vaccine to me I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll give it to these guys and they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll have extra protection.
0	No vaccine for me ever! Cut my head off so I can be with Jesus Christ & God Almighty!!
0	UNICEF is the wing of yahudi. Do not believe in it. Why they participating in spreding fake corona vaccine.
0	they can shove that vaccine where the sun dont shine.... i refuse to take anything they have to offer
1	You don‚Äôt want the shot don‚Äôt get it, but the people who want it should have the option too. Don‚Äôt stop them it‚Äôs their right.
0	Thank You moderna got my first vaccine get my booster late this month.
0	Go to Life site News and listen to a Dr, informs you of that they are not telling us!
1	I got the vaccine, moderna one, and I was just very sleepy lol
0	LOL no just no couldn't pay me enough to get that shit
1	To anyone worried about long term side effects: I really don't think there's any real mechanism to cause long term harm. As far as the mRNA itself, it's literally just strains of mRNA that code for (relatively inert) proteins. Our body uses mRNA to code for proteins all the time, so that isn't new. There's no virus involved at any point so there's no risk of infection. The technology is pretty good at replicating how viruses work, and that process itself isn't associated with any long term effects. There HAVE been mRNA vaccines before, specifically the one for Ebola - which I believe was in stage 3 trials and got an emergency use authorization. I'm pretty good at examining potential consequences, and really the only thing outside of normal immune reaction side effects I can think is an excessive inflammatory reaction related to the delivery mechanism.
1	Getting mine Sunday morning after my 12 hr night shift in the COVID icu! Happy to be part of the solution!
1	It should be free once it is released, it is for the benefit of the society, not individuals.
1	As soon as I can. I can't afford to die/get severe complications from Covid-19. I am 51 and I need it! 2 friends have several severe complications from having it.
1	I want a choice in what vaccine I'll choose to be inoculated with. Soon a single shot, temperature stable, viral vector vaccine will be available -- a game changer for sure
0	I had a professor in med school who said ‚Äú Don‚Äôt ever be the first or the last to try a medication‚Äù. I‚Äôm planning on doing exactly that.
0	They are volunteering for vaccines for getting off loans... We know where we failed
0	Covid programs allowed on youtube still...hmmmm....sooo, this is the "information" they want us to believe....
1	I don't want to get COVID!
1	Who would have ever thought that the end of the human race will be at the hand of idiotic conspiracy theorists?
0	Why didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you mention the nanoparticles/aluminum in the Phizer and Moderna vaccine.
0	We do not know whether the vaccine will prevent infection and protect against onward transmission.
1	Brother just got his second dose today and my SIL gets hers later this week. Just wish I could get the jab but I get to wait a bit longer.
0	I sure as heck am NOT taking that thing
0	Second shot is making people sick!
1	Yep. Lost my grandfather a few days ago to covid. I hope people can get this vaccine soon so no one has to deal with this any longer.
0	The only one getting immunity is the manufacturer.
0	Wow. Pfisor makes their own study.. aren't responsible for harm...and the ones making money on it. How dumb do people have to be to believe these Demon's.
1	When the vaccine is available, I will get it as soon as possible because I believe in the science behind it and believe the benefits greatly outweigh the risks.
1	To everyone who's afraid of microchip tracking through vaccines, wait till you find out about cellphones and social security numbers.
0	My mom has said that she doesn‚Äôt want to take the COVID 19 vaccine. She says this is because the vaccine has ‚Äúkilled almost everyone who took it‚Äù.
1	I'm definitely more scared of covid and would do it yearly if I had to.
1	Hoping for pfizers vaccine, but I'm happy to take any of them
1	when i was 5, i tripped and fell. I do not walk now to prevent myself from tripping, join me and levitate everywhere. Make sure your kids levitate too or they might trip
0	2:09 there are √¢‚Ç¨ÀúCURRENTLY√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ no reasons to be concerned about the vaccination.... I rest my case.
0	What people don't understand is that Western Medicine is built for profits not cures. Just imagine if every disease and illness known to man is cured. How will these pharmaceutical, CDC and FDA make their money??? So remember this when you go to a doctor or deal with insurance companies or medication all of this are made for profits only. No one ever in the history of medicine talks about boosting the immune system the frontline to fighting off bacteria and viruses. These drugs that put out in the markets are designed purposely to have side effects to keep you depending on Western Medicine.
0	This vaccine has not been tested on immunocompromised Cancer patients, so my husband‚Äôs oncologist advises against taking it @ this time.
0	Take an unproven vaccine whose manufacturers won't even take responsibility for bad outcomes, to avoid the sniffles? Nope.
0	If your agents ever show up on my property with a "vaccine", I'll teach you a lesson you'll never forget.
1	Thank you for your enormous work, so difficult in this moment. Vaccination is an act of civilization. We have to take care of each other. #iamhere
0	I will never take that vaccine hell no people are dying from this vaccine I don't care what anyone says
1	TOGETHER WE FIGHT AGAINST COVID-19
0	It‚Äôs not anti vaccines it‚Äôs that we have woke the hell up to your plans
0	C'mon man! Now...here's the deal... The doc died from the vaccine. CASE CLOSED!
1	watin for the vaccine, definately getting it
0	The virus isn't deadly enough, let's make a deadlier vaccine.
1	Vaccine manufacturers are given protection because extremely rare (less than 1:1,000,000) side effects don‚Äôt outweigh the overall good that vaccines do but would bankrupt any pharmaceutical company that made them through civil suits
1	FIRE them for being stupid. Unless you have a history of severe allergies and anaphylaxis you should be getting the vaccine. These people will go straight to hell for their selfishness and putting other at risk.
0	i dont want your bloody vaccine
0	I won't be taking the vaccine especially after what the flu vaccine did to me
1	COVID-19 : I Love Infecting And Killing People Vaccine : IM GOING TO END THIS VIRUSES CARRER

1	Wow a lot of anti vaxxers in the comment. I can't wait to get my second shot soon!
0	I'll never take your Covid shot!!!!
0	The Great Reset or do they mean the great culling don't forget your vaccine folks.  OPEN YOUR EYES PEOPLE.   (These pricks will kill you.) If we cannot see the big picture by now (agenda21)  what hope have we got?   Good luck everyone.
0	Do not take vaccine, don't listen to fauci aka dr fraud.
1	I would feel like a complete fucking scum if the earth, if I found I accidentally spread the virus and someone died because of my inaction.
1	got my second dose last week no sideeffects. Feels great!!
0	This is my body I am not cattle on a farm to be I injected by a public health official that views me as a HERD of infectios wild animal
1	I just had my first dose today and have no side effects what so ever and I never felt the needle go in either
1	No, they're not. These vaccines went through the exact same process that any other drug goes through. It went faster because the vaccines had top priority and were able to jump the line ahead of every other drug the FDA was evaluating. In other words, no steps in proving effectiveness or safety were skipped. These same mullets who are saying they don't trust the vaccine are the same ones that demand we "listen to the science". Oh the irony.
1	Many health agencies across the globe have found the vaccine to be safe. The benefits of the vaccine are not only preventing infection for yourself (thus preventing your own death and long term health effects from covid), but also should include slowing the spread of covid and preventing you from transmitting it others.
0	Just passing this on  I have carefully studied the development of the covid vaccines and many things about them are very concerning to me:   First of all, up until this point there has never been any successful vaccine for coronaviruses in humans due to a problem typical of coronavirus vaccine development called antibody dependent enhancement or ADE. [1] In preliminary animal trials for previous coronavirus vaccines (SARS and MERS), animals were vaccinated and seemed to exhibit a robust antibody response, but upon exposure to the wild virus, they developed a paradoxical immune enhancement leading to severe organ inflammation (especially in lungs), and they died. [2][3] Paradoxical immune response in coronavirus vaccines has also taken place in human trials, which occurred during testing of the failed RSV vaccines of the 1950s. [4] Alarmingly, there are some statistical indications of ADE in covid vaccine trials, but there is no way to know for sure because many key signifiers of ADE weren‚Äôt specifically addressed. [5] Due to emergency protocol, the usual method of testing animals prior to humans was bypassed, limited animal testing occurred in parallel with humans, and the potential for ADE was not comprehensively assessed. [6] [7] Historical precedent would suggest, however, that ADE is a distinct possibility, and we may not know the true negative effects until years from now when vaccinated persons are exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or genetically similar versions of coronavirus. [8]   Second, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines contain lipid nanoparticles that are ‚ÄúPEGylated‚Äù, meaning the nanoparticles are coated with PEG (polyethylene glycol).[9] PEGs can lead to life threatening anaphylaxis or other conditions such as thrombocytopenia. [10] [50] Such reactions are already occurring during the initial vaccine rollout and PEGs are the most likely culprit. [11] Approximately 72% of the US population have PEG antibodies, with 8% having extremely elevated levels (more than 500 ng/mL), putting them at risk for severe allergic reaction and/or future autoimmune disorders. [12] These reactions were totally predictable, with many experts warning of the danger posed by PEGs [13][14][15], yet participants with a history of severe allergic reaction were excluded from the trials, serving to obscure the actual negative impact PEGs will have now that these vaccines are being given to members of the public who have not been screened for PEG antibodies. [16] Also, there is some worrying evidence to suggest that PEGs cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain, possibly causing inflammation and/or autoimmune conditions, a fact gleaned from previous animal studies on mRNA vaccines. PEGs were found to be distributed across a spectrum of tissues including the brain. [52] Additionally, nanoparticles (such as PEGylated hydrogel) are known components for state of the art medical interventions, including biosurveillance technology currently being developed by DARPA and companies like Profusa Inc. [17][18][19][20][21] The secretive nature of this technology necessitates a knowledge gap between developers and the general public, so although my research efforts have yet to verify a direct functional relationship between PEGylated nanoparticles used in covid vaccines and biosurveillance, I personally do not relish the prospect of being injected with such given their association with biosurveillance technology of the military industrial complex.   Third, it is impossible to ascertain long term safety because of the foreshortened timeframe of Operation Warp Speed. [22] Vaccines should be tested for multiple years to adequately assess their longterm effects. [23] Short term safety is questionable too, as much of the data is still unavailable, and the current reports on safety and efficacy essentially amount to self-reported press releases from these companies themselves. [24]   Fourth, the efficacy number of 90% for Pfizer and 94% for Moderna is statistically misleading, reporting a relative reduction instead of absolute reduction of risk*. Also, the trials only assessed these vaccines‚Äô ability to prevent mild symptoms and NOT their ability to prevent transmission. [25] If they don‚Äôt prevent people from transmitting the virus (especially when safer, cheaper drugs like Ivermectin do) [26] [27] what‚Äôs the point?   Fifth, these are NOT vaccines in the normal sense. They are mRNA vaccines, which utilize a completely different process for achieving disease protection**; mRNA vaccines seek to introduce messenger RNA into the body in order to ‚Äútrick‚Äù cells into producing immunogens, which then stimulate an immune response. [28] These vaccines are the first of their kind ever to gain authorization. [29] Current vaccinations are essentially an extension of phase 3 of the trials. [30] Because of the lack of long term safety assessment and the new nature of this technology, people are participating in a mass human experiment with no way of knowing the long term health effects these could cause. Many problems from vaccines are known to have an incubatory period and do not manifest until much later, which is why testing needs to occur for multiple years in order to adequately assess risk. [31] One such problem currently being discussed is the mRNA technology‚Äôs possible impact on female fertility, as it encourages the production of antibodies against a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that contains a very similar protein crucial for the development of placenta called syncytin-1. This could interfere with the reproductive process by encouraging the immune system to react against syncytin-1, thereby disrupting placental development. [32] The vaccines‚Äô impact on fertility is currently unknown as animal reproductive toxicity studies have not been completed. [33]   Sixth, there was a signature for many different problems seen in the various trials and initial rollout for these vaccines, problems that are concurrent with commonly documented vaccine injuries. Injuries that did occur in the various trials/rollout have included, but are not limited to, anaphylaxis, Bell‚Äôs palsy, transverse myelitis, multi-system inflammatory syndrome, encephalomyelitis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, and death. [34] [35] [36] [37] [50] [51]   Seventh, and perhaps most importantly, the movement toward potential vaccine mandates or other coercive policies violates humanity‚Äôs most universally accepted principles of human rights and medical ethics, especially for a medical intervention with so many known and unknown safety/efficacy concerns. The absolute bedrock of medical ethics is the right to informed consent, as individuals must be made fully aware of all the potential benefits and risks associated with a medical intervention, while still maintaining the right to decline that intervention should they so choose. [41] Mandates or coercive measures fundamentally violate historical safeguards humanity has put in place to protect us from the ever present threat of medical tyranny, including the Nuremberg Code, the United Nations‚Äô International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and UNESCO‚Äôs Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights. [42] [43] [49] Such would also be in violation of the Hippocratic Oath, for not only do oath keepers pledge first to do no harm, but also to treat the needs of the patient. [44] This implies that a doctor‚Äôs duty primarily pertains to the needs of the individual before the needs of the collective, a vital distinction made by Hippocrates and understood for nearly 2 millennia. [45] [46] Privileging the needs of the collective is a ‚Äúfallacy of misplaced concreteness‚Äù. [47] While individual need is directly apprehensible and consensual, collective need is an abstract, subjective concept not easily defined. And yet who usually gets to define this concept? Such is most often defined by those in power with the most means to influence institutional narratives, turning medical professionals who treat the needs of the collective according to this definition into mere extensions of that power at the expense of individual informed consent.
0	Vaccines are part of an agenda the elites created for depopulation they‚Äôre killing our babies with these ‚Äúsafe‚Äù vaccines.

1	Anti vaxxers are misinforming ignorant people. I trust science and would definitely get the vaccine.
0	Never never never
1	I don‚Äôt get flu shots never have. I will get covid vaccine since it does not require annual shots.
1	‚Äôm willing to get a vaccine when it‚Äôs my turn, but as a healthy adult, it says there are 268.7 million people ahead of me.
0	Anyone here can have my share....Cheers
0	Dont get that bullcrap vaccine near my kids
0	This has not been engineered to stop by vaccine!

0	This commercial has been brought to you by Pharma Inc.
0	MODERNA has violent side effects.
1	Vaccines need to be a law.
1	I took Pfizer yesterday am fatigued and Have chills am Glad I took off today bc I wouldn't have been able to go to work but other than that am fine arm a Lil sore which is to be expected
0	No vaccine for aids, cancer, but in one year y'all have vaccine for covid ü§£ü§£ naw I'm good
0	Hell no .They couldn't pay me to take it.
1	I vaccinate because I'm not retarded.
1	Smart man! We need 70% of the population to be vaccinated in order to stop this pandemic in its tracks. Let‚Äôs do this people! Everyone wants to go back to normal!
1	Anti Vaxxers should pay for their medical costs if they contact Covid-19
0	As for me and my household, we shall not take this V.
0	Still not getting THIS vaccine and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m no anti-vaxxer at all.
0	I got mine yesterday My arm hurts and I feel like I have the flu.
0	That‚Äôll be the Nano technology in your system changing your DNA bruv. good luck to you
1	My elderly mom got her 1st shot yesterday and is doing well..was the mederna brand
1	Vaxxed
0	I just want to see it be used a bit more and see the effects it has before I take it.
1	That is great news. This man is a world treasure.
0	Thx 4 sharing. It helps. I always wondered all that'.
0	NO THEY ARE NOT SAFE!!!! And the W.H.O know this already.
0	Give me 50 grand ill take it otherwise no
1	If the top professionals in health care are having it, then it's good enough for me too
0	I‚Äôm not your guinea pig, maybe you are but I‚Äôm not.
0	How about inside the lab that created covid-19
1	I‚Äôll receive vaccination. Healthy medical person should be a early adopter or pioneer in Japan. Let‚Äôs save the world!
0	Keep up the good work! You have prevented COUNTLESS children from being another vaccine injury story. GOD BLESS YOU ALL!
0	I'm not taking anything I have to sign a waiver on.
0	I won't be taking any covid test, or vaccine and will be encouraging others not to. I haven't worn a mask or washed my hands since the scandemic began and yet here I am fit as a fiddle with my vegan diet. Men who dig pits for others will fall in it themselves.
1	This just proves how much technology has progressed. Vaccines usually take years to devolve and require live samples and now it can be produced with a genetic code on a computer screen.
0	Medical "scientists" , don't know how most Rx drugs work - they have theories about pathways being blocked or opened but not MUCh more.....That's why once an RX drug is FDA approved and then the awful effects unwanted start maiming people THAT's when it gets taken OFF the experiment on people/market...
1	If this vaccine comes out, I'm gonna be the first in line to get it. It is gonna be as refreshing as waking up from a nightmare
0	Would rather have the virus then go anywhere near the vaccine, never trust a jobsworth
1	Looks in antivaxxers head:nope no sign of a brain
0	Ok so basically they ramping up death shots got it
1	I have a Rammstein concert in September so y'all better get your vaccination.
0	Why do I need it if my body fights it off naturally.
1	What a relief. My mother received her first dose on Saturday. She is 70, with COPD, and she has hunkered down for this entire pandemic. To think that, once the vaccine does its job, she can survive this virus as if it were a cold? Well, it is simply a huge relief.
1	Absolutely yes. If there were substantial negative side effects we‚Äôd have seen them by now. That‚Äôs what such extensive trials are for.
1	will help to break the chain of transmission of COVID-19
0	My mother died of covid one week ago 5 or 6 days after receiving the first dose of the vaccine...i will never take it
0	I'm anti government, anti system, anti a lot of things, not anti vax. But in this particular case, i'm not taking the vaccine. I don't want things to go "back to normal". I want things to become better. So this is my form of protest kind of (i'm in Germany)
0	I‚Äôve already recovered from covid and we don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll throw our immune system into overdrive from it
1	WTF antivaxxers youre crazy
0	I won‚Äôt be having a rushed vaccine, perhaps when they understand the side effects and that won‚Äôt be for quite a while yet.
1	Her being against vaccines because she had a bad reaction, is like someone say is against exercise and is bad for you, because she sprained her ankle once.
0	When the government says safe and effective so many times I know I should run for the hill
0	I don‚Äôt mind to be the last person on earth to take the vaccine
1	We take Vaccines and medicines so we dont die at 50 like they did 200 years ago. Its not rocket science
1	So we apparently know nothing about this virus yet weve managed to develeop a "vaccine" in 9 months
0	I WOULD RATHER LIVE ON A CYBER DUMP THAN TAKE THIS
0	The work you are doing is incredible and you've helped create probably the most powerful movement on the truth about vaccines. Well done to you all. Keep it up and more and more people will awaken to the lies and deception.
1	Order aside, I just wish they'd accelerate things. On a per capita basis we're roughly 30th of 50 states. Embarrassing, and unacceptable.
0	I, a New York citizen, Stand in total agreement with the Californians! üíØ% No poison for me! üôÖüèæ‚ôÄ
1	I wish there was a way to make being antivax punishable by death. That is the only thing that can stop them.
0	DON'T GET THE VACCINE My friend got covid and recovered in just a few days. Nothing super significant about that right? Wrong! He has CF (cystic fibrosis) which is a major issue with the lungs. Research says that people with pre-existing diseases WILL die if they get covid. Like I said, he was fine. He told me it was nothing more than an intense flu. In just a few days, he got over it. One last thing, HE DID NOT HAVE THE VACCINE. Besides, do people really know what is actually in this Vaccine? This could be the easiest way ever that whoever made these "vaccines" take over the world. All they would need to have done is put some sort of devise in with the vaccine that enables them to access the brain, and ta da, they take over. (Just sayin.)
0	side effects, just like covid symptoms hahaha.
0	The guy said mRNA have not been relatively used before, actually mRNA vaccines have never been used before covid
1	Had Trudeau done this last May instead of pandering to the likes of Chi*a we would have our own vaccines by now and able to sell or give to other countries.
1	We can‚Äôt put in to words how excited we were to give 97 year-old Facey patient Ruth Zamora the first dose of vaccine at our newly opened vaccination clinic in Mission Hills this morning.
0	These doctors are eugenicists. Psycopaths.
0	I had a flu shot years ago and I have a permanent side effect. Tendentious in my right ankle. But never again for me.
0	Nothing beats a strong immune system. There is no money in it.
1	If not enough people vaccinate, then there doesn't form an immunity for everyone.
0	One word: "NEVER"
1	Grateful to receive my first dose of the Vaccine!
0	Thalidomide was said to be safe My mother was offered it but refused.
0	My mom got transverse myelitis from a flu shot.. it has ruined her life...
0	Dont care how you make it look like I'm not taking it until a year or so. Wait for others to be the test dummies.
1	I hope Pfizer can match the expected production. Would be nice to have 100 million doses per month.
1	It varies a lot by socio-economic status and race. FWIW, I don‚Äôt know any anti-vaxxers either.
1	It would be great if the city had more appt. only vaccine clinics vs. the mass vaccination clinics without appointments. Most people are working and can't wait around for hours to get the vaccine. An appt. would allow people to schedule time off from work to get their vaccine.
1	I don‚Äôt care about ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù so long as I‚Äôm protected against COVID. If others want to reject vaccination, they can please themselves. I‚Äôll be getting vaccinated.
0	The Large drug companies are already asking for indemnity against prosecution against future unintended side effects of any C19 vaccine , very confidence inspiring that is !
1	Mayors, governors, the President, etc. should be vaccinated immediately. Regardless of their political beliefs its critical that the people running our governments are healthy and on the job. Remember what happened when Trump got sick? The Government went into free fall and there was serious concerns about who was making critical decisions. You don't want that even on a state or local level.
1	i would love you not to vaccinate your kids if you do have one, so there would be less retards like you in this planet bcs they died at the young age
1	I'm unaware of any anti vaxxers I know IRL, I am however aware of people who do not want to get the covid vaccine, though I think they have been coming around on it lately.
0	Whoever wants mine can have it I don‚Äôt want or need it if I die from it my blood is on the democrats they brought this crap to the United States to steal our election
1	Goes right along with Qanon and election fraud. The land of the ill informed.
1	Take the vaccine live for the gang √∞≈∏‚Äô¬Ø
1	the risks of getting vaccinated are very very low but the risks of not getting vaccinated are very high.
0	Give it to the pigs first.
0	Vaccines will go down as the biggest fraud in medical history in 20 years
0	They can have mine. I am a Senior an don't plan to use one.
0	No vaccine for me.
1	There is a lag Between getting #Covid19vaccination & Protection. Vaccine protects most, but not all infection. Vaccines don‚Äôt work Retroactively. Certain Variants could be less Susceptible to vaccines. Vaccines prevent disease but not all infection.
1	Got my first vac today. I have to wait 3 wks for the second vac. Glad I'm getting it done. No more worries!
0	üòêIts gonna be a NO for me.
1	mRNA is located outside the nucleus of your cells (in the cytoplasm where it will be translated into protein), so no, it will not alter your DNA or üß¨ code.
0	WHAT HAPPENED ABOUT JOHNSON & JOHNSON COVID-19 VACCINE? IT WAS READY AT THE SAME TIME OF PFIZER VACCINE.
0	My body, my choice.
0	More than 20 people vaccinated with the pfizer vaccine died in Norway.
1	I read all these anti-vax comments and I think to myself: I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
1	A miracle.
1	Doctors have the Effective Covid-19 vaccine the Pandemic Comes to an End June 2021!
0	Y‚Äôall finna turn into zombies
0	Nope. My children will not have it. There is zero research about how children will react to it.
0	Take fresh herbs they are all antiviral and stop worrying..The reason they wish so many vaccinated is to eliminate the control group. Yes, I do believe we can improve our immune systems functions of working to protect us. I just disagree with the methods used and imposed upon us. Vaccinations are toxic by their ingredients and cause an inflammatory response and in some cases can knock the immune system well off kilter. Building health with fresh herbs that are antimicrobial and antiviral, antibacterial etc, has no such issues. Mother nature has all the kindness, mans science has all the cut burn and poison. Which many of us now are trying to recover from.
1	Update. I‚Äôm 5 days post first injection all is well
1	I'ma take it
0	What about the ingredients? Never hear about them. No thank you!
0	Let the Sheeple get the vaccine, its going to be interesting watching the results. We are going to sit back and see what happens to these people after getting the vaccine.
1	If you have allergies to vaccines dont get them but dont prevent others from getting them.
1	Poison..no.i will NOT GET IT
0	Angelo Me too I'm not having this poison in my body just to be a rat on a wheel
0	You can have mine, I‚Äôll pass!
1	I just got my vaccine yesterday. My body feels so heavy especially my left arm.
1	Got my Pfizer vaccine 1st dose today, about 8 hours ago. Feels about the same as a flu shot. Shoulder a bit sore, a bit fatigued. I think after a good nights sleep tonight I'll be fine
0	Id like to know the death tole from these vaccines a year from now
0	I've been surrounded by people with Covid & I have not yet got it. Meaning I'm immune... Why the hell would I want this type of vaccine.
1	There are 1.1 billion anti-vaxers according to plague inc, so if that is true, it proves human stupidity.
0	Can your next video be about the vaccine deaths that have been covered up??? √∞≈∏Àú‚Äö Smiling during your video just makes you appear even more evil than lining your pockets to sell out your integrity.
1	People, just get the vaccine, it will save you and everyone else around you, please for the love of god
0	Interesting how the vaccine and rise in cases and they predict a rise as more in the next couple of months ...hmmmn..sound a little more than telling that they are not safe
0	thats like saying- shoot me in the head first- and i will take notes afterward...
1	Please correct me if I'm wrong but, when you have an R of 2.5, you would only need 60% of the people vaccinated/immune to get it down to R=1 right?  So we don't need 100% vaccination to get the R below 1.  Anyone knows what the R-value of Covid-19 is without any social distancing?
1	Gotta love a bunch of random people just saying that this has been proven, that one dude was wearing a doctor's uniform so he must have done rigourous scientific research
1	Guys I can‚Äôt thank you enough, I didn‚Äôt know it was just a little peace of the virus.  Now I feel saver to get it.
0	HELL NO I WOULD NOT TAKE IT
0	Wonder how much Pfizer payed that ginger lad to hype it up
1	Anti vaxxers should be put on a list and denied medical help when they contract COVID ! Simple
0	You can't pay me to take it
1	Please everyone. Take the vaccine to flatten the curve everyone its serious
1	That means, Coronavirus will end soon!
1	How about we actually get a vaccine before we start worrying about what yahoos won‚Äôt take it.
0	We've only just started vaccinating and people are dying already from the jabs , what the heck is going on , why isn't the MSM reporting this
1	Plot twist: Coronavirus was created to get rid of Antivaxers
0	POISONED BY VACCINE very common Unbelief of the concept it was done on purpose by the manufacturer
0	I won't be taking the vaccine especially after what the flu vaccine did to me. I was sick for 6 months
1	I just got my first vaccine today. No side effects so far.
0	No, don‚Äôt trust that shit at all
1	Perhaps I am an optimist as it is too early to tell - but there is something.. unusual happening with the hospitalization data. Cases continue to rise (and positivity rates in most places as well, so it's not just more testing) but hospitalizations have started to inflect.
0	NWO BOTTOM LINE!!!
1	We live in the age of MISINFORMATION, more people would rather believe some random post they saw a friend post on Facebook than listen to an actual scientist. Truly crazy times we live in
0	I'm not Anti-Vax but I do not trust this vaccine and would prefer to wait a few before taking it. I don't trust this vaccine at all.
1	Anti-Vaxxers are crazy. Serious side effects from vaccines are rare. Even vaccines that effects you higher than the average will be protecting a person from that disease.
0	the vaccine is made by man and man is not perfect. how can we expect that it will be perfect and free of any side effects
1	mRNA does not alter your genetics and this method of developing vaccines has been studied for over a decade now.
0	I'm not gonna take the vaccine
1	This was so valuable!!  Thank you for this.
1	I am so excited to get my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine
1	Or they attempt to go on an aeroplane and discover the airline, or other country, won't let them enter without vaccination.
1	Fantastic news! Best headline I‚Äôve read in a long time. Let‚Äôs hope we can get them distributed to the front line workers and elderly fast!
0	My only issue with taking it is whether it‚Äôs safe. Has safety been compromised due to the rush to get it out.
1	It's the beginning of the end, boys! I know this might've been said tens of thousands of times but for a pandemic virus we knew nothing about in January, a working vaccine being shipped 11 months later is a truly extraordinary feat.
0	I think that we should wait, atleast three years, to see the results, in the long term, of the vaccine.
1	the risks of getting vaccinated are very very low but the risks of not getting vaccinated are very high. if enough people are vaccinated then the anti vaxxers will be fine because of herd immunity but if no one gets vaccinated, they will all be seriously ill and die at a younger age.
1	I'll take the vaccine. Wish I didn't have to wait til summer. But I'll get it no matter what.
1	I got my Covid vaccination this morning. Such a sense of relief and gratitude to the NHS and scientists who made it happen.
1	My mom didn‚Äôt get my vaccine very often and I always got sick, but recently she became full antivaxx that I now have to rely on my dad to help me get my vaccine. So antivaxx moms can say oh props to your mom, shut up, I recently got the flu because I didn‚Äôt get the vaccine it was horrible don‚Äôt put your kid through it!!!
1	Got the vaccine. No side effects at all!
1	I challenge all anti vaxers to go to a covid ward with no protection and take a deep breath near a covid patient.
0	NOPE Never gonna take your rushed poison for a cold with a 99.8% survival rate.
0	Something tells me this "survey" was asked to about 6 people.
1	First dose taken. Never felt better <3
0	10% out of 43000 got the virus AFTER the vaccine? That‚Äôs 4300 people that got the virus. I don‚Äôt like those odds..
0	Why has no other RNA vaccine ever been approved.
1	I am in the Moderna Phase 3 Cove Study Trial. I chose to volunteer and participate because I want to help get a vaccine out and I feel compelled to help and contribute to society in regards to this pandemic. This Coronavirus Pandemic. Needs to be something of the past and we need to move forward with our lives. Thank you to all volunteers and participants of all clinical trials and to all doctors and nurses. Thank you for this very well instructed video regards to such a sensitive topic!
1	I am pro vaccination but these companies really do have Fallout series style names...
1	Covid - Kills 1 in 50 people (2% mortality rate) Vaccine - Has side effects in fewer than 1 in a million people (Less than 0.000001%)
0	I don't know anyone who is excited about vaccine roll-out..
1	Anti vaxxers: "There is no proof of the virus" People and medical workers who've died from the virus:ok I guess
1	Than what explanation is for those children who received vaccines and are fine? That some vaccines are tainted? And the lucky children had an untainted vaccine?
0	We won't know what the long term effects are for at least a year or longer from this being widely distributed. It's perfectly sensible to not rush to take a newly developed vaccine - and to reserve it for those who have a priority need for it.
0	Nope
0	What about the man that died from it right after getting it today in the media idk if it happened today or yeaterday n he wasnt old that I know of
0	MEDICAL TYRANNY not allowed to say no to poison
1	I also heard a lot of "I'll let other people take it first to see how it goes" turn into I want to get it asap. So far so good
0	Plenty of vaccinations don't provide immunity ;only a false sense of safety.....Most people with ACQUIRED immunity are better at not getting the disease again.
1	Those at risk from previously eliminated disease (eg Infants, Elderley and those with suppressed immune systems) are at risk of death - and the Anti-Vaxx movement are complicit in this for weakening our species' herd immunity.
1	I'm a pro-vaxxer!
0	Last time I had a vaccine, my body shut down on me I ended up in an icu for 3 months with organ failure! NO VACCINE FOR ME!
1	I won't have to wear a mask soon ask i have taken the vaccine!
0	Sounds like one is playing the Russian rulet when choosing to take the vaccine
1	Proud to say that i got #Vaccinated against #Covid19
1	Just when you think there's a little bit of light  re. Covid vaccine..Dad had his yesterday Fab! Mum due to receive hers today... postponed
0	My whole family don't use vaccine until it's been used and successful in short my fam doesn't want to take vaccines that are literally just made
1	But my coworkers say that the vaccines still have the same death rate as the virus. First off I dont believe anything that comes out of their mouths. Second where do these people get their "information "?
1	I got my vaccine this past Friday. It went really well!
1	23 million people already have it in the uk with zero symptoms and are perfectly fine
1	I think the legitimacy of the vaccine is very promising.
0	A lot of health care professionals have said they are going to wait a year.
0	Ppp have died and passed out from that vaccine shjt i just knew it before ir happened by studying how currupted yall united states country always going to continue to bees if they befn dojn for decades they definitely not stop in or slowing down they gotta Tribble movie plan and dey fonba make sure nothing gets in they ways
0	rushed to market mRNA vaccines may do more harm than good.
1	Yes because getting Covid19 is not option me
1	I will be getting it to promote herd immunity and protect those that cannot get the vaccine, and I would love to travel internationally again!
1	The worst thing will be that those people will say "look i didn't get vaccinated and I'm totally fine, this vaccine is useless"
0	So, we are being used as Guinea pigs.
0	The only one getting immunity is Pfizer.
1	Vaccination is freedom, guys.
1	Vaccination only works when enough people do it. GET VACCINATED!!
1	If people would just take a totally safe vaccine then we would be so much safer
1	Bend over for big pharma everybody!
1	its over 90 % safe just take it already!!
1	I have had my vaccine and am very grateful looking forward to the second one now. Starting to feel safer. Thankyou.
0	The health department order is for you not to think too much about your personal self preservation against being injected with there poison for the greater good of EXPERTS
1	There's no "Pro-vaccine" There's just "Anti-vaccine" and normal people
1	The weapon to end the war...
0	i‚Äôm not taking anything that changes my DNA smd
0	You can push it day and night, not taking it. :)
1	we will get vaccinated as soon as we can to be able to travel and visit them without infecting them
1	It's acceptable to have a healthy dose of skepticism for anything, however I trust the doctors, researchers, and everyone who had hands on developing this more than a random tin-foil hat wearing youtuber saying it'll turn me into a gay frog.
0	If immunity lasts few months after a covid illness, how do we know that an individual's immunity after this vaccine will sustain longer?
1	When filling out the registration forms for the drive thru vaccination sites, is it necessary to fill out the reason for the appointment? I really want to get this done as fast as possible.
1	My hospital gets our first batch next week and I‚Äôll probably get vaccinated in 2 weeks. Stoked. Hopefully no side effects.
1	About time. I can‚Äôt wait for this nightmare to be over.
1	I cant wait to get to vaccine so life can get back to normal
0	No. They. Just want to kill us! This is not a joke!
1	Bless you WHO, I cant wait to take the vaccine
0	No thanks, you can keep your vaccine, we have an immune system for a reason.
0	I‚Äôm in UK and literally can‚Äôt understand why anyone in their right mind would want this vaccine. It‚Äôs had 5% of the normal testing time and you can‚Äôt sue if it goes wrong!!!! ??? !
1	For sure. I'm positive now and it freaking sucks. I couldn't eat without throwing up and just washing dishes feels like running a marathon.
1	Thank you I will take it
0	How on Earth most medical "professionals" can call all of these cases a coincidence is beyond me! It's a level of delusional I can't imagine.
0	Lady, you are lucky you don't live closer to me ... "we often get a sore arm ..." I got a little more than a sore arm!! I got permanent disability!! It's not anxiety. IT'S BAD NEWS THAT THEY HAVE A VACCINE THIS QUICKLY. DON'TN TRUST THE CDC - SEE "VAXXED" the movie if you want to see the CDC in action.
0	The mRNA in the vaccine tells the cells to create a protein that stops the fertility of the virus that will effect your fertility also you wont get kids,
0	The larger point is you don‚Äôt vaccinate people for a virus that kills .002%. Has a 99.997% survival rate. Clearly something else is going on. Clearly the vaccine isn‚Äôt safe.
0	If people in the health care field have reservations about this vaccine, that's all I need to know. I'd rather take my chances with a virus that has an over 99% survival rate.
1	I will take the vaccine because of solidarity reasons, i will do whats best for society as a whole.
0	I passed on the vaccine would rather take my chances on my natural immune system given to me by God.
0	Ever stay up late or work 3rd shift ? This vaccine reminds me of them late night ads that say ,If u have bleeding or black outside or leg falls off plz stop taking and consult ur primary doctor hahahahaha ,Ready for ur shot Sir? NEGATIVE :0
0	Are you guys going to make the rdif chip video too?
1	Imagine thinking you‚Äôre tough and ‚Äòfearless‚Äô for refusing medical treatment that could save your life or the life of your family members. These people‚Äôs brains are fucking warped.
1	Got the vaccine a week ago and i feel great :)
0	4:30 Is he just said "SAVE" AFTER 2 WEEKS of using it.... wow naughty....
0	It‚Äôs garbage. A scam for the taxpayer. It causes paralyzation and gonnorhea.
0	When you get injected by vaccine. You have no where to run from the 666 mark.
1	these anti vaccine people dont see the bigger picture.
1	We are excited to be a part of history, hoping to get back to our normal lifestyle and see everyone smile again!
0	A good mother always knows best. #Mama over big phrama.
0	Why do you trust these people, and you don't even know them personally they are trying to lower world population to five hundred million it is written on the Georgia Guidestones which is their mock ten commandments. They are using the vaccines for population control. Some people will have adverse reactions, and die.
1	Its all about herd immunity.
0	Let's say it like it is, forced vaccines = rape.
0	Something is NOT RIGHT about this vaccination crap
1	I made my appointment in advance waiting for high risk health issues to be eligible in my state and have been so eager to get it and protect myself
0	The very fact it's being pushed worldwide in a rapid pace, while not needed. Should make you question and not take it.
1	I find it strange how little trust there is in research that has had virtually unlimited funding and support worldwide.
1	Only in America would people protest your getting a vaccine that would save your life.
1	Well I just caught Covid last week so I guess I have no choice but to wait for the vaccine now
1	BREAKING COVID-19 VACCINE UPDATE - Russia‚Äôs Vaccine Is Safe and Effective, Published Study Shows
0	No To vaccination we know who is behind it...
0	wow wasted my time... never watching ABC again.
1	I'm tearing up that this is finally coming. It's been such a tough last 9 months here in the rural midwest where the majority of people don't take things seriously and then people die. Hopefully this is a sign that we're almost at the end.
1	You don't have to get the vaccine now, but it would be the smart thing to do.
1	the risks of getting covid outweigh the risks of the vaccine
0	All sheepeople line up first
1	Just got part 1 of my vaccine today it didn't feel any different from a flu shot. My arm is definitely more sore afterwards though. Literally just got it today so let's see how long that lasts.
0	My mom and brother are probably going to take it but im personally gonna wait a bit and see if people start having issues or not, if noone had issues sure i'll take it but if they do i'll wait a bit longer
1	It's like being anti-surgery because there's a death rate for every operation.
0	I hate to say it but this is starting to look like natural selection on a vast scale. Thousands of cars formed queues miles long and waited for hours to get vaccinated at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. Hundreds of people tried to hand them leaflets with information about the "vaccine", it's ingredients and it's dangers. The sheep kept their car windows tightly closed. Just like little children sticking their fingers in their ears and yelling "Na-na-na-na". Those pamphlets could have saved their lives.
0	I'm not interested in how you feel now, I'm interested in how you are after 2-10 years with the vaccine in your body
1	I‚Äôm 33 and have been lucky enough to grow up with all 4 grandparents in my life. November 31st one of my grandpas died of COVID. Last week the other 3 went to the same place together and got dose 1 of the vaccine. I wish he had of been here just a little longer.
1	Yea I'm nervous too, for those exact reasons. But I'm probably going to get it ASAP. I'd rather roll the dice on a vaccine and its side effects instead of Covid and its side effects.
0	There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm taking this shit
0	I am scared because I never had it
0	Watching anything to do with vaccines never fails to make me cry!
1	Dumbasses who don't vaccinate literally put my life in danger.
1	I think we overestimate the amount of anti vaxxers. I think itsjust that they're the vocal minority so sometimes especially online it can appear that everyone is an anti vaxxer even though it isn't true
1	Medicine is good. Anti science is fraud.
1	Just because you have an adverse reaction to vaccines doesn‚Äôt mean nobody should get vaccines
0	I will never tamper with my bodies Natural functions by putting this crap inside me..id rather get the virus
0	How vaccines work? Sure, ... inject you with toxins that hurt you, and make you part of the list of people who may die from this covid that is searching for the right person?
1	Because her daughter can‚Äôt get vaccinated, she should be begging everyone else to get vaccinated.
1	Anti vax strikes back
0	Maybe I should do a survey in my town on  who was asked to do this so called survey probably zero.
1	Beginning of the end.... of the pandemic*
1	Seek medical advice and get vaccinated.
0	Phahk Fauci, Birx and all the t@ssers at the CDC and in Biden's charade. Oh, and his now new claim (after saying masks are not necessary) that wearing 2 or more masks is safer than wearing one.......YUCK FOU. Just wear the whole box already.
0	Can we inject all politicians and their children with the vaccine first? Then I'll trust it won't kill me
0	Trump said he won't take so I'm not taking it
0	There is no point by the end of 2020 we'll probably all be dead anyway √∞≈∏Àú‚Äö
0	SAY NO TO CORONA VIRUS VACCINE
1	You can give mine to some stupid Democrat
1	I am lucky to have an appointment next week.
1	I just got my first vaccine today. No side effects so far. Thank you to all the scientists and researchers around the world for making the vaccine available this early and thank you for this channel for spreading the science. Yes, it‚Äôs definitely OK to be smart. Science rules!!!!
1	"Feelings are often immune to facts" I loved this statement, it's very true, Anti-Vaxxers would not accept, understand or comprehend Scientific and Statistic proofs, they just keep throwing misinformation and very weak arguments that do not make sense at all.
0	Yeah I'll get the vaccine in the next life R IP
1	Yes! I have taken the vaccine finally!!!
1	Vaccines aren't just for your health, they're for everyone else's too
0	Why not let politicians and celebrities take it first, since they're all so confident in it?
1	Hey so I decided to get the COVID vaccine yesterday I‚Äôm okay my arm is a little sore but it will go away but I feel great with no side effects
1	I‚Äôd rather have minor allergies than have polio
0	I would not see myself as a man if I put the vaccine in my childrens body
0	I think its all  a sick sick lie and the damn  mark of the beast in n a way people change this is u zee
1	I'm definitely taking it
0	I'm not going to get any sort of covid 19 vaccine ok! I REFUSE AND I COMPLETELY RESIST!!! I don't need this!
0	I'm so sorry for the families shattered by vaccine injuries. Thank you to these families who share their heartbreaks. You are saving so many lives!!!! Please people wake up.
0	The nurses at the hospital i work at that got the vaccination had to take days off of work from the side effects. Severe headaches, puking, feeling dead and lethargic
0	When it 'normally' takes between 10 to 15 years to develop such a vaccine and one miraculously comes out in a few months . . . . no wonder I'm sceptical! AND, to add further suspicion, the leading provider insists on the buyers signing a liability disclaimer . . . . what am I supposed to think?
0	My aunt took 2 doses of the vaccine and now she's really really sick. And then you see persons also dying, getting seizures and heart attacks. If they said it's a weakened form of the virus then how weaken is it?
1	Okay, I'll have an immunity while y'all fucks are dying around me.
1	I‚Äôm vaccinated!
1	I just got my second dose and no reaction to any dose whatsoever.
1	just got my second dose yesterday! God bless everyone, stay safe
0	First you both inject this tasty mRNA vaccine, upload your video of both doses.
1	Been Covid positive twice already,have auto immune disease and had my first dose of covid jab! Hurrah! I'm still alive!
0	i just watched a video that said people can turn into a reptile after taking the vaccine
0	Even health officials are calling this political bullshit. The firefighters and medical professionals don't even wanna take this greedy death curse.
0	People are waking up to the fact that vaccine injury it‚Äôs way widespread than we thought!!
1	So a doctor on the new this morning said her second dose in the trial gave her "robust" response. I kind of chuckled at that description.  Usually when I get the flu shot, I feel bleh for a few hours, then I'm okay. My temp goes up, but not feverish, I get muscle aches and cold/hot. This time around I was on an immune system "cocktail" for a few weeks. when I got my flu shot I had no reaction except my sinuses seemed to clear up.  I wonder if there have been any studies if things like Vitamin B, C, D, zinc, etc might lessen the side effects.
1	We like the shot! üíâüíâ
1	I'm signed up for my first vaccine dose on Monday (I work at the hospital) and I was a little nervous. I feel a lot more prepared now!
1	Thank you, had my vaccination yesterday. I am one of many that appreciates what you are doing.
0	I wouldn't take any vaccine or any medication that was exempt from Criminal litigation as a result of damage to the recipient.
1	Yes. Definitely. The trials of the big ones look solid. I'm keen.
0	That effin vaccine killed my mother today. She was fine before getting it. Do not take it EVER
0	A Whole Load Of Bs
0	Soo......it is a test vaccin....:))) Go to Hell with this vaccin.....
0	nothing is safe from you or gates.
0	8/9 months to study, produce, test, market and inject the first RNA-based vaccine.  Innovative or experimental?
0	I just don't take vaccines that I don't need. There's plenty vaccines I haven't got and I won't get a vaccine cause it's the in risk now.
1	We‚Äôre definitely picking up speed now.
0	There is no way I‚Äôm taking a vaccine right away. I‚Äôm waiting at least a year to see what happens to y‚Äôall.
0	no way in hell would I take any of those vaccines... I'll take my 99% chance of survival with the covid. Those odds are good to me.
0	I'm surprised YouTube allowed this video, oh its bs no wonder
1	I think it shows the FDA panel is taking the approval process and the scientific merits of the data seriously at least! which is good IMO
0	Do syringes grow on trees or in the ground? If its not found in nature then its not ment to be in the body its called common sense
0	Seems like you both are well informed about vaccinations, why not make your own vaccines?
0	If this vaccine is so good why is it killing people all over the world
0	Makes no sense take a vaccine n wear a mask üò∑ ding ding nwo n mrna
0	Population control. Well done.
0	They're all pseudoscience pushing eugenics
0	Bill Gates has enough money to end world hunger instead he is creating more vaccines! Coincedence?
1	I'd rather risk a Covid-19 vaccine side effect as opposed to actually getting covid-19
1	I wasvaccinated on 01/22, still doing good! Had mild soreness at site of injection for first two days. No other symptoms, but still monitoring
1	I'm allergic to eggs and I finally this year was able to find someone who'd give me a flu shot. I felt a little flushed for a few minutes afterwards, but that's it. Much less than the side effect my family suffered of having to put up with me for another year.
1	More vaccine for the rest of us
0	It turns you in to a flesh eating √∞≈∏¬ß≈∏√¢‚Ç¨ÔÜç√¢‚Ñ¢‚Äö√Ø¬∏ÔÜè.
1	Received mine on Friday! So glad things are speeding up
1	The fact the ymca has now had a covid case and I‚Äôm still hearing people say they won‚Äôt get the vaccine. Plz just fucking get it I don‚Äôt want covid coz I passed someone in the corridor who‚Äôs been partying because ‚Äúcovid is a hoax and the vaccine has dead baby‚Äôs in‚Äù
0	Im not taking this lie
0	Keep it. I don¬¥t need it.
0	I don't want to be first in line, will wait a few months so you know more about the sideeffects
1	I‚Äôm surprised people are skeptical about the vaccine. I‚Äôm the only one at my work said I‚Äôll be down taking once it is available to us.
1	Yes, and I regard anti-vaxxers as criminals who should lose custody of their children.
1	Antivaxxers will be the death of themselves
1	I've read the info and believe in science, and I believed these vaccines were safe and effective basically for a while now. But this news... As someone who's parents are very high risk, it really confirms it for me. It gives me so much hope that they'll be safe once they receive their two doses. I feel more relief now than I did when I received my own doses.
0	Heck no you should not get it. It is full of harmful chemicals. This has all been planned to get chemicals into us. They want to destroy our bodies.
1	I just don't know where to put my face after so many people using god as a foundation of anti vaccination, like can't you just shut up you embarrassing me in front of the atheist
0	Hence the adverse reactions. Everyone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s genetic make up differs. This nano tech can deduce each one. I think not. Common sense
1	So basically anti vaxxers dont wash their hands since soap only kills 99.9% of germs
0	Covid has a 99.02% survival rate... and 98% of people dont seem to notice they catch it... so by my math and your info, a 4% better chance of survival and health if I dont take vaccine.
0	My daughter is 23yo....she is autistic....at 18 months she was ahead of most children in milestones had a vocabulary of about 70-80 words....she received her 18 month needle ....became very ill....the next day she stopped talking and reverted into a world of her own...she didn't talk again for years and still to this day has communication issues
0	So if we are doing a risk benefit analysis of getting the vax or contracting it naturally and my risk is very low of either dying or having permanent damage.... Then why am I getting this vax again?
0	The good old brainwashing machine is at it again calling the truth lies. Need to question who‚Äôs profiting from the vaccine? The very people pushing it. Human guinea pigs. Please read the ingredients!
0	I don't feel like I need it, im 27 and perfectly healthy. Old and weak people can get it first
0	death sentence
0	viruses have always been with us, and our immune system should fight it without any of those rna nano super safe vaccine
0	I need more Info. For now, I'll social distance, eat well, exercise etc.  Then 6 months from now see some results such as Is the vaccine more harmful than the virus or If the vaccine wipes out Covid-19 o_o
1	Pfizer made it!
0	This isn‚Äôt about a virus and it‚Äôs not about ‚Äúsaving lives‚Äù. That notion is laughable. This is about a major unprecedented push for control globally.
1	I just got my first shot today in the Astrazenica trial. I'm willing to risk a lot to help to find a safe vaccine for everyone.
1	FIFA should come forward with financial assistance to the poor Nations to help mass vaccination.
1	I will queue to be the first to take it. Legit.
0	I‚Äùm rolling my sleeve up as we speak...NOT!
0	I will never put a vaccine in my body
0	I'll trust my immune system. Keep the vaccines!
1	2st should be teacher
1	why we need to take vaccine if the virus has 99.9% survival rate ??
1	I want everyone to be safe and healthy, I want Covid numbers to go down.
1	I couldn't even watch this, because the anti-vax comments were so typically idiotic it hurt.
0	Statistics and views on this are fo make people get it? Everyone I have spoken to said there not getting it. This is from all ages.
0	YOU SHOULD NEVER TRUST THIS VACCINE
1	Don‚Äôt let perfect be the enemy of good. Vaccines aren‚Äôt designed for 95% avoidance of symptomatic illness. The fact that not one, but two vaccines did is a miracle beyond comparison. But J&J providing 72% protection and 100% protection from death in ONE shot that doesn‚Äôt require ultra-cold storage, is also a miracle
0	Hesitant?I'm down right terrified
1	I need you to get the covid vaccine
1	My sister had a reaction to a vaccine and can't get certain ones. She's still pro-vaccine.
0	Stick your vaccine where the sun don't shine, more people need to wake up.
0	This guy is a shill, only Jesus can save us NOT a vaccine.
0	I'm Very Lucky. My Creator gave Me a Damn Good Immune System. Sorry about Your problem
0	You kidding me?! Not enough people are getting the virus so we're purposely injecting, and making super spreaders????
0	Buck parker seriously. Info from cnn. Yeah no. There's doctors who say dont get it because of way better reasons than cnn. But at least you has good reasons
1	Oxford's covid vax is just tweeking an existing vax that has already proven to be safe. So you should have no worries on that specific vax.
1	People its a shot its 5 sec i willl really not effect you, you will prob forget abt it in a couple years
0	There's many reasons NOT to take any vaccine ESPECIALLY  this one
1	I‚Äôm getting my first vaccine today
1	I was scheduled to get a vaccine after seeing my doctor but the appointment was cancelled due to shortages, but if I can get a new appt I am still 100% on board with getting the shot. I will feel much safer
1	Why are people so stupid and ignore science and knowledge.
1	My Mom is getting her second dose of Moderna sometime this month and it will take so much stress off of me. This past year has been Hell for me, she‚Äôs high risk and so anytime I‚Äôve gone to pick up groceries or had to go anywhere I‚Äôve gotten so stressed because I don‚Äôt want to be responsible for her death.
1	WHO should be providing free vaccines to the low income countries!
1	New title. 50% OF THE PEOPLE WE ASKED said they would not get the vaccine.
0	Please dont vaccinate i dont want my kids to have corona
0	I think I will pass on the vaxx and take my chances.
0	Sad we went from testing in labs to using humans as guinea pigs
1	I can‚Äôt wait to get mine
1	People can't even figure out how to spell basic words correctly - they're not gonna be able to grasp what vaccine effectiveness means, unfortunately.
1	i'm 16 and i just got my first covid-19 vaccine. i have full trust in this system and it being the most affective way to get out of this situation. go get vaccinated.
1	mRNA vaccines have been studied before for flu, Zika, rabies, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). As soon as the necessary information about the virus that causes COVID-19 was available, scientists began designing the mRNA instructions for cells to build the unique spike protein into an mRNA vaccine.
0	I‚Äôll pass.
0	This confirmed my decision I made a while ago...I'm not taking !
0	Look, don't take the vaccine, no skin of anyone's nose if you take your chances and then contract the virus. If you were unfortunate enough to react badly to the virus I'm sure you'd want to refuse oxygen or medical help too, which would be only fair.
0	I think I'll wait about 15 years before trying this out
0	I‚Äôm sceptical about it due to how fast it‚Äôs been developed, I‚Äôm more worried about long term effects
1	When my mum had her first vaccination we were both so relieved.
1	Just stick my vaccination on the back of my stimulus check.. I'll take it, YOU CAN TRUST ME
1	the best thing people can do, is stop watching the "news"..
1	thankful for these people who are willing to help the process for the betterment of the world. You guys are warriors!!!
1	Find a dr who says donot get this vaccine..l
0	how can we be sure that the DNA does not integrate with host DNA?
0	Jesus is the Truth and the Holy Spirit is the Vaccine. Thanks
1	Oof, I‚Äôm getting my first dose tomorrow and I‚Äôm kind of nervous, but this made me feel a little better
1	When a population takes vaccines, it leads to a herd immunity effect.
0	Psuedo science "logic": No one dies from the vaccine because we attribute all deaths to Covid.
0	Listening to our government is like following a wild animal
1	I am in the Moderna Phase 3 Cove Study Trial. I chose to volunteer and participate because I want to help get a vaccine out and I feel compelled to help and contribute to society in regards to this pandemic.
0	It's the beginning of the end of Freedom . Screw the vaccine .
1	Well, have fun taking your chances everyone, I'm getting it. Really not a hard decision. You seem to be afraid of what you don't understand, but to me this really isn't scary at all. This is technology, and I'm taking advantage of it.
0	why aren‚Äôt you saying how many people died right after getting the vaccine ? since you know it causes soreness ? i‚Äôm sure you heard how norway is advising no one to take this nano particle vaccine
0	How about posting my middle finger to the covid scamdemic and the poisonous, experimental and completly unnecessary vaccines that will never ever enter me or my family's body?
0	I'd rather get the virus than this vaccine. The virus isn't as bad as they make out.
1	When you are offered vaccination ACCEPT it. I come from a time when polio was still a scourge and none of my friends, or I, had the chance of a ' jab ': some were left with marked deformation, I was lucky with just a thinner left leg and shoulder higher than the other. Unfortunately my being canted to the right was a major factor in my spinal problems as I grew older, resulting in major surgery in my 30s.
1	Take a vaccine for a virus with a 99% survivability rate? No thanks. I'll take my chances. I've had the common cold (covid) many times. I lived. This is about control. Nothing more
1	I received my first vaccine today :)
1	your chances of getting infected after a vaccine are lower than so-called "natural immunity"
0	no one needs this poison...
1	People are just idiots if they dont take the shot
0	What a load of propaganda - "she's playing her part". That just demonises those who don't as 'not playing their' part' in keeping society safe. What game is the UN playing here. Let's not forget that it was the UN's cover up for China that contributed to the virus teaching pandemic proportions. The V sign I'm holding up is the British one, which means... This vaccine is too rushed. The UN can't say what is going to happen in the long run. More studies need to be done, but for the sake of business and profit, they are going ahead.
0	Man-made Vaccine to "cure" a man-made Disease. I know Genocide when I smell it, and this smells like Genocide . DISLIKE
0	Exercise, go for a walk a jog sweat during a workout drink water orange juice something your body can fight its known to fight
0	i‚Äôm not scared about an allergic reaction i‚Äôm scared about the long term effects because we don‚Äôt know what they are
1	I am ready for this to be over too, I'm ready for people to stop dying, I'm ready for my parents to be able to hug and kiss their grand children. I'm ready for the world to be safe again.
1	come and bring your vaccines to florida.. NOW
0	As a African my ancestors never needed man made medecine. Nature made herbs only I dont eat man made food, I'm vegan.
1	Thank you, these informative communications are always useful and welcome. At the same time I think that at the moment the critical part is to find ways to expedite production and administration of the vaccines. There are many willing to get the shot that still need to wait. #iamhere
0	So I'm not anti vaxx, but this is the only vaccine I am not getting. They rushed it. We don't know exactly what will happen
0	I have a child with autism and I began to see a change im my son just hours after his MMR vaccine. This documentary holds absolute truth on this government/vaccine conspiracy
0	Im not taking their poison!!!!
0	No. I feel like all three of the Covid vaccinations have been rushed. I want to hear about the side effects to the first people who have taken them. From the volunteers who did a trial with this, I haven‚Äôt heard anything positive
0	I have a friend who has a child that got autistic after a vaccine.
0	Or just take Vitimin D3 and Zinc and eat fresh food and go and exercise and hug your friends and let your immune system do its job without a filthy rag around your mouth and nostrils
0	The same heavy metals that are in the vaccines they are now dumping on us by the ton from aircraft.
0	Sure sounds like his death was caused by that shitty vaccine
1	One case out of millions. I'm totally willing to take those odds to be protected even somewhat from COVID-19. Maybe view the video one more time and try to pay attention. It was a very clear, fair and objective explanation. Just because so far there is no final conclusion is no reason to go flying off into panic.
1	If I could, I would have taken the phase 3 trials. I'd be the first in whatever line for the vaccine.
1	Fantastic news, consider me in line!
0	This is why I will never take the covid-19 vaccine period.
1	My main concern is not whether or not I get infected, but whether I spread it to someone less fortunate.
1	‚ÄúImagine a vaccine so safe that you have to be threatened to take it, for a virus that‚Äôs so deadly that you must take a test to even know if you have it.‚Äù -John Smith
0	So why is the news reporting that people are testing positive for Covid-19 after getting the vaccine?
0	I reacted to one Vaccine now I won‚Äôt vaccinate again.
1	Complications from vaccines are classified as very rare occuring in less than 0.1% of the population that takes it.
1	Vaccine have eradicated several serious viruses please take it y'all!
0	What about all the people that are having major reactions, with some dieing from these vaccines?
1	I'm a healthcare worker and I have my appointment to get it on Friday! I'm so excited.
1	You can get the vaccine now (two, actually). I got mine in college when I went into healthcare
1	So happy we can get more to the folks who need them. Well done.
0	Thank you for the detailed scientific explanation. Can we be assured this vaccination is perfectly safe? Can we really trust Pfizer/Big Pharma? Do you have complete trust in Pfizer and in the clinical trials? Personally, I have no trust in them. They are immune from liability lawsuits. I guess when you have that much money and power, you are untouchable.
0	Don't let them use fear to drive their agenda.
1	Yes because it's important I do for those who cannot because of their health. I have a responsibility to keep up the heard imunity
1	I'm so happy - my mother-in-law in LTC received her first vaccine shot yesterday. You have no idea what a relief it is, we've been petrified for almost a year. Every phone call would send the heart racing.
0	I will take the vaccine once I know it's 100% safe. Am worried about the sideeffects
1	I have zero issue in taking a Covid19 vaccine when it's made available.
0	Their smart they don't want or poison
0	dont take the vaccine, my moms a nurse they can't come up with a vaccine that quickly please, it will harm you within a year. Watch the new years 2021 seattle space needle show and you will see symbology......like a dna strand, a butterfly and more.
0	Im sure they ruled it out as "SIDs" even though it was actually the vaccines ...sad
0	Tell your parents you are not vaccinating your child‚Ä¶
1	Yes, I will. I'd rather be a guinea pig for any possible long-term effects for the vaccine than for long-term effects of Covid. That said, it'll be a while before I am eligible (30s, no co-morbidities).
1	Perhaps you should ask if DM is a credible news source before using it as a decision maker. Most health care professionals I know, including myself are getting the vaccine.
0	So why take the vaccine if it's not helping the virus why should I put that poison in me? I am not taking it it's all about controling humans and money
1	I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had the vaccine last week and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m doing great no reaction at all...waiting for the 2nd doze
0	I'd love to see another video with both of you getting the vaccine and then reporting a day a week later how your feeling
0	By your own explanation, since I've already had the virus the mRNA has already done it's thing, therefore the vaccination will do nothing for me that my body hasn't already done. Yes?
0	I‚Äôm not getting this political vaccine üíâ
0	Sounds to me like the beginning of planet of the apes
1	Fourth in line! Gimme!
0	Someone else can have mine.
1	Everyone needs this vaccine, let's pray we get the shot on time.
1	You know what‚Äôs amazing? The coronavirus first arrived on our shores about 10 to 11 months ago. And look at how much historic progress we are rapidly making on the COVID vaccines! I am very proud of humanity‚Äôs biomedical science.
1	If it makes it past FDA with appropriate screening, proper Phase I/II/III trials/metas, then yes.
1	I will be taking it, no doubt. Got vulnerable family members.
0	I think the global panic has lead to a vaccine being rushed and 5 months of testing is, in my totally uneducated opinion, not long enough to prove there won't be any adverse effects down the line.
0	mainstream brainwash. if you think vaccines are healthy you‚Äôre a slave.
0	How can I feel secure if the government signed a full disclaimers for vaccine manufacturers in case of side effects??
0	Death is the side effect.
1	Anti-vaccine party‚Äôs are stupid..
0	You'd have to be a damn fool to get that fast-tracked vaccine.
0	Vaccination should be given to those who claim its safe.
0	Idgaf who gets it but im not  My body my choice
0	Researchers have found a surprising link between covid 19 and erectile dysfunction in men who recovered from the disease, both short and long-term. It stands to reason that the vaccine would do the same thing.
0	How about deaths in Norway? This is just the beginning
1	I have had my vaccine. Thank you researchers for your ingenuity! Lifesaving work.
0	55 dead in America 29 dead in Norway 10 dead in Germany ... from covid vaccine so far.  This guy's full of shi*
0	Why do people want a vaccine?  The Australian vaccine has been halted, as those vaccinated were testing positive for HIV antibodies. Could have something to do with the HIV protein they had included. You think? A 'Conspiracy Theory' over the last 10+ years has been that HIV was spread across Africa, hidden in vaccines. That doesn't seem too wild a theory now, does it?
1	all the front line workers should be vaccinated first they have and still are risking own lives to save others
1	They are lying ...and after. Trump and dr fauci i dont trust them none of these fools
1	Vaccines are the safest and most tested treatments we have today. Could this future vaccine get rushed out before it‚Äôs ready for prime time? I mean sure, but that doesn‚Äôt seem likely.
1	I‚Äôm a pro-vaxxer. Anyone want to have a debate about vaccines?
0	I have had a severe reaction to flu shots in the past. I am allergic to nickel and Sulfa and these were ingredients in these shots which made me horribly ill for as long as 2 months and having to spend nights at the bathroom because crawling to the bathroom once took everything I had to get there. I have not taken any flu shots since the last time it caused devastating reactions for me in the late 90s. I never regretted it because I have not suffered from the flu since that horrible shot. How do I know that this shot does not contain these ingredients? I am reluctant to take the vaccine because I never fair well with secondary effects.  I am allergic to opiates (such as Vicodin, morphine, and Norco), also statins, and can only tolerate a smaller dosage of lesser than 50% of Percocet without going under...as in induced into a comma I can't get out of for days. I avoid pharmaceuticals if there is a naturopathic alternative.
1	Herd immunity is our way out of this crisis!
0	"We ll make you invalids". Pf.zer. who wants my dose? For free
1	Any progress toward prioritizing Indiana teachers for COVID vaccination?
0	If there is a vaccine there's gonna be side effects that we don't know about
1	Even if vaccines can cause autism and it's a big if. It's still better than everyone dying of influenza or other preventable diseases. Polio is much worse than autism
1	me having to repeat myself over and over again means that it really isnt that hard to understand the benefits of vaccines
0	It's amazing how a vaccine can be made in a couple of weeks for a new variant,  I smell bullshit
0	Isn't it suspicious tho that a vaccine was developed rather quickly?
1	Hopefully this vaccine works, I‚Äôm ready to get back to normal!
1	Private companies, transport, insurance, etc requiring it will speed up the acceptance.
0	Read psalms 91.  The best protection against covid without side effects.  No mercenaries involved
1	If the vaccine is meets the approval of top immunologists and epidemiologists, then no doubt about it.
1	I hope this works I got COVID and I‚Äôm getting it tomorrow :)
0	ANTIVAXX FOR LIFE
0	We are not taking it so piss off
0	Allergic reaction. How about just Fucking Poison
0	No one wants to be a lab rat for the next thalidomide.
0	They are not FDA approved!!! Not getting anything that is not FDA APPROVED!!!
1	50% of Americans don‚Äôt want to take the vaccine. That‚Äôs a problem for 100% of America I fear.
0	The only way If i'd be sure is if Boris is in front of me and we have a wheel of vaccines, and we spin it, and I choose his Vaccine shot! then I wait 10months and watch his effects. What about Kids after? they may be Effected like before? Breathing issues? Fncking hell man.
0	No I wouldn't take it I want to live
0	I don't trust that PCR swab test either - and I don't care what anyone thinks about me I ain't taking any of it.
1	I took mine on Tuesday. Felt like a normal flu shot and my arm was sore for 2-3 days.
0	I like and love my immune system. My choice. My belief. No COVID19 vaccine. Period.
1	Vaccination saves lives.
0	You can keep it, i the VIRUS isn't that serious, u can believe what u want
1	I want to keep the people I love safe, so I‚Äòm first in line. Thank you for being so outspoken about this.
1	When most of this makes sense cause you learned it in biology
1	I‚Äôm not opposed but I‚Äôm in no rush to be first in line to take it...
1	I got my first dose and now i am waiting for the second one.
0	MSM hear me loud and clear: NO VACCINE FOR ME or my child. 100% a NO from me. Have a nice day :-)
1	Show a little respect to those doctors and researchers trying to find the vaccine in less than a year!!!!
0	Pffft, who needs a vaccine when you've got those flintstone vitamin gummies from 10 years ago.
0	Wow, so going on my third generation of no vaccination in my family is again proven good.
1	Antivaxxers are a dumb breed of people
1	Unvaccinated people should NOT be allowed to walk free among us.
0	If a company has been granted immunity against any lawsuits in the future for any possible long term side effects of the vaccine then eh... count me out!
1	The mRNA vaccines cannot alter your DNA. The ingredients of the vaccine do not enter your cell's nucleus, which is where your DNA is stored. Instead, the vaccine simply offers instructions to your cells. Your cells read the instructions, and then they create antibodies against the spike protein found on the SARS-COV-2 virus. The instructions that were sent in the vaccine simply fall apart and disappear.
0	Yea vaccines that cause deaths
1	Of course it's safe! There's a chance you might get an allergic reaction, but it'll be over in mere hours!
1	I am so surprised there is so much anti vaccine sentiment. The adverse event is extremely rare if you comparing with medicines on the market already.
0	These two men, I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t believe not one word they tell us. These two men are way to scripted, way to excited and way to happy about the vaccines.
0	I‚Äôve gotten a flu vaccine, A month ago and I feel like I‚Äôm going to regret it. I just learned how bad the flu vaccine was after I got it. I‚Äôm spiritual and have been aware of the toxic covid 19 vaccine. Honesty I don‚Äôt feel like my usual self. I am currently detoxing from it. Should I just let go of this fear? I really hope I have not messed up my DNA.
1	Vaccination has to be stepped up quickly.
1	Sign me up! The second I'm allowed to get it I'm gonna be there. I"m gonna make it an event. I'll wear a nice dress. Anything to help stop the spread and end this.
0	I‚Äôd rather get herpes than take this
0	You cannot put MRC5 (14 week old aborted fetal tissue dna) into the temple of God, period.
1	And Im sitting here in good old Germany where they fucked everything up and people are going to be waiting month to get a vaccine. I did some research on a site and it suggested that if we continue to vaccine people this fast, then I'll be able to get one in November 2023. smfh.
0	I haven‚Äôt been ill for 5 years nearly my whole year got covid and I‚Äôm fine I‚Äôm not taking the vaccine
1	Can't understand how people spreads misinformation. Vaccine is safe
1	I thought the first wave of vaccines were for emergency workers, hospital workers and other important people?
0	"The vaccine should be tested on politicians first. If they survive, THE VACCINE IS SAFE. If they don't, then THE COUNTRY IS SAFE" by Polish Author.
0	Then they start eating people
1	I overheard a conversation at Barry island today between two elderly people, commenting how brilliant their experience at West quay medical was at the Saturday vaccination clinic...." So efficient....straight in and out we were".
1	It looks like I'm behind around 20 million or so. I'll get my vaccines the moment I am allowed to!
1	The only vaccine that I refuse to get is the flu vaccine.
1	I don't vaccinate my kids. I believe its harmful to them and could lead to complications. I let my doctor do it, he's done it and studied how to for years.
1	See, I want the vaccine so that I CAN spend 15 hours in a Target.
0	I'd like to wait 2 years for it.
0	All vaccines adverse reactions listed directly on the package insert is : DEATH
1	There are no anti vaxxer vids on YT that explain why they are of the opinion they are...
0	Keep calm and get Get bill and melinda in ur arm.
1	My moms a healthcare worker and she‚Äôs getting her first dose of the vaccine today and she‚Äôs kind of nervous, thank you for this video it helps a lot
1	Thank you! I hope y'all continue to stay as safe over there in California as possible, and that you are able get your vaccines when you're able to!
0	New drugs have very very strict procedures in the development and testing before given final approval , this can take years, yet in a natter of nine months the process is complete and licenced for immediate use ! Nobody knows the possible side effect implications. I will take my chance and will not be having the vaccine !
0	This guy should be in jail the vaccine is killing people.
0	The vaccines aren't safe at all
1	There are many heroes emerging during this pandemic. These guys, arguably, are at the top of the heap!
1	I'm more scared of covid than of any potential vaccine side effects!
1	Many thanks for walking us through the process of mRNA and how the vaccine would work.  This helps a lot to understand and bring people to get vaccinated.  Salutations de Montr√©al!
1	I want the vaccine, but I'm about to start 5 rounds of radiation and chemo soon, and someone told me that the since that will pretty much ruin my immune system, it would take out the effects of the vaccine anyway. Is that true of an RNA vaccine?
0	If that is not enough to get you convinced, nothing will, you are doomed. View the film VAXXED asap. Get on board with the anti-vaccination mouvement before its too late.
0	Most doctors in America should be put in prison for their lies. I haven‚Äôt taken a vaccine shot in 5 years and haven‚Äôt been sick. When I was taking vaccines, I‚Äôve gotten sick. Vaccines aren‚Äôt for everybody.
1	" The bigest sideffect of vaccines is fewer dead children " That is savage
0	Anti vax? Or free choice?
1	That's interesting to know. But the title of your video is miss leading. Please remember that people in the UK will watch this, the Oxford vaccine is a different type.
0	Because I don‚Äôt want to have it, end of.
0	What about risks of long term side effects?
1	Tin-foilers: "Lockdowns and mandatory masks infringe on muh rights!"  Also tin-foilers: "The vaccine will put an end to all this? Try to jab me and see what happens, buddy!"
1	Let‚Äôs do this people! Everyone wants to go back to normal!
1	I want the vaccine
1	I want a choice in what vaccine I'll choose to be inoculated with.  Soon a single shot, temperature stable, viral vector vaccine will be available -- a game changer for sure...üëç!
1	I'm immune compromised and I can't wait to be one of the first to get it!
0	I'm ready to quit the moment my employer says I have to take a vaccine.
1	My distinctly non-religious Dad will be going to church on a Sunday morning for the first time in my life this week. For his COVID vaccination. I couldn't be happier.
0	SAY NO My body, my decision.
1	It's hard to have an intelligent and informative conversation with anti-vaxxers. It really is. Because their side is ridiculous.
1	Fuck it, I‚Äôm willing to guinea pig this one. Even if it turns out to be ineffective, at least my data can be used to prove it and also help work towards a different one.
1	i'm an essential worker so i'm def getting the vaccine asap!
0	Never gonna take it hahahahahaüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
1	I received the Moderna vaccine 3 days ago. I feel fine so far.
0	I‚Äôm refusing it, I don‚Äôt need it, I don‚Äôt trust this crooked government I‚Äôve broke every rule and have never felt better, let me live my life.
1	My MD said it was up to me if I wanted to get vaccinated since I might not mount a sufficient immune response. Since the vaccine is made of mRNA instead of actual virus, my doctor wasn‚Äôt worried about it making me sick. So far I‚Äôve gotten my first dose last week and feel fine.
1	I‚Äôve had the vaccine last week and I‚Äôm doing great no reaction at all...waiting for the 2nd doze
0	anti-vaxer is just a made up term so the media can blame
1	vaccines are like seatbelts. if you get in an accident they won‚Äôt 100% protect you from getting harmed, but you‚Äôd rather wear one then not
0	I REALLY appreciate that Dr. Yasmin made the distinction between Anti-Vaxers and Vaccine-Hesitant. Ostracizing and mocking people hesitant to take a vaccine that was developed in an insanely short period of time is counterproductive. I think it is reasonable for people to want more evidence than they might usually require for such a vaccine.
0	They lying dont take it
0	Great idea, just water it down a bit, and now it's good for 5 times as many sheep as before. Now I have complete confidence that they know what they are doing.
0	I don't want it. and you can't force it if I am free and no I don't trust no one.
0	Why should I take a vaccine when I can't sue the company in case I get side affects that are deadly?
1	the antivaccines people are that type of people who said "i don t know" if they re ask for their allergies
1	I am proudly vaxxinated. No side effects. :-)
1	Thank you very much for this clear information and for your most valuable work. Vaccines are the only way to get rid of this pandemic
1	They are RIGHT! Healthcare workers over the WHOLE WORLD should have top priority.
0	Someone else can have mine I really don‚Äôt mind.
0	Contagion theory is false. A person cannot spread a virus unless it is in a vaccine. Viruses are just the bodies way of eliminating toxins from the body.
1	I love the benefit of them.
1	I plan on it to protect myself from the ill people the income in contact with and hope to return to traveling internationally.
1	I rather get potential sideeffects than live the life we do now
0	Don't allow vaccines it's evil thing it is introduced by the ant Christ Bill gets
0	And yet people are dying who have taken the vaccines
1	I‚Äôm hoping that once I am working for Duke come January I will have arrived in time to still get the vaccine. My current facility started administering it yesterday and I have to wait until January so I can get both doses from one location
1	I‚Äôm all for vaccines because I believe in science and the effectiveness of vaccines.
0	no one is sticking a needle in me not in a million years
1	Happy to see Germany contributing to stop this horrific pandemic, go biontech!
1	I have autism myself, and no. Vaccines do NOT give autism, autism is a disorder that some people get permanently upon birth.
0	Only shot I'm taking has a bullet in the chamber....at least I know where I stand with God!
1	Good to see COVID vaccination campaign has also launched in Pakistan today.
0	They are safe for no one.
0	Don't worry, soon the media will tell you there's a new mutation, vaccine doesn't work anymore. Oh no, there will be another mutation after that.
0	I'll keep my DNA the way it is, away from synthetic mRNA, toxic metals and who knows what else.
0	Still not touching it with a barge pole - sorry! Have done too much research of my own
0	So you have a chance to die twice :D who wouldn't want that. Update: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  Just answered that dudes question lets see if youtube will post it :o
0	death is also it side effect
1	This was very helpful, thank you!
0	If your immune system is working, why do you need the vaccine in the first place?
1	I finally had my vaccine this morning! A great system and lovely staff members and volunteers down at Redwood Education Centre
1	Yeah, I'm drinking copious amounts of tea this morning too. Hey ho. We'll get through this sure enough. And spring has nearly sprung, then summer and by then we should all have had our vaccines.....
0	She is absolutely right its poison keep it for the sheep never a pandemic never was we are being controlled!!! Mat hancock literally laughing at everyone says it all
1	I‚Äôm a teacher. I can‚Äôt wait until I can get a vaccine and hopefully get my students all back in person again
1	I‚Äôm not anti vaccine.
0	I will not comply.. Government is a damm joke
1	Let's get the vaccine and be done with this.
1	On the day the WHO officially declares this thing as downgraded to endemic, we should mark it as a global holiday.
1	70% vaccinated would bring herd immunity.... let‚Äôs get vaccinated so we can all go back to a normal existence again.
1	This is a clearly expressed and informative video about the process of ensuring that vaccines are safe. Reassuring to learn of the steps being taken. It does not seek to address the tiny number of adverse events that have occurred - and rightly so. That's for another video. Thank you WHO for working so hard - and I appreciate  it's cumulative work built up over decades, not just a knee-jerk reaction to this particular pandemic.
0	It really saddens me to see this many ppl who dont mind getting repeated injections of the most harmful chemical's known to man. Wake up ppl!
0	You two youngsters have certainly drank the kool-aid. Do you do ANY research yourself or do you just believe what you are told? Never mind, i know the answer to that question. Sure hope no one listens to you, but unfortunately, i know some will.
0	You're presenting theories as facts. mRNA technology has not been adequately or unequivacably proven. I do not want a chemical messing with my immune system. I'll boost my system naturally thank you.
1	Thank you... I feel encouraged to now get the vaccine
1	I am 100% taking it
0	That is who committed the murder, their poison
1	Within a couple of weeks my whole family should be vaccinated (other than me, I‚Äôll be at the end). It‚Äôs a really good feeling.
1	Everyone wants to go back to normal! Vaccination is the solution.
1	This was how my mom was, but once they got to her school (she‚Äôs a para) she signed up.
1	Such good information hope this makes people take the vaccine!!!
0	This vaccine is probably where the zombies come from!
0	Not going to take it
0	Apparently the side effects are horrendous.
0	High amount of vit. C, Zinc and Vit. D. And you'll be fine.
1	I got the Covid-19 vaccine today.
0	I dont know a single person who is willing to take it
1	You both need to listen toDr Simone Gold and Professor Delores Cahill (immune biologist!)
1	Keep up the great work. Almost all people +80 covered.
0	I WILL NEVER GET THIS VACCINE ! It needs more time to develope !!!!!!!!!!!!
1	Somehow antivaxers believe in coincidences, how do they explain that polio is virtually nonexistent in countries with the highest rate of polio vaccine? It‚Äôs just that they won‚Äôt admit it.
1	These are all coincidences. Vaccines don't cause death I think you're getting mixed up, it's anti Vax people that cause death. If someone can't get the vax for some reason, and then 6 other ppl in their class CHOOSE not too then it's not only putting your child at risk, it's also putting all the children who physically CAN'T have the vax in danger. You put your siblings, friends and everyone who can't have it done in danger. It keeps getting passed on and turns into an epidemic.
0	Yea and why are they censoring all the doctors on YouTube that have been speaking against taking this vaccine ...if its safe why censor them what are they trying to hide. They must think the ppl are stupid
1	Thank you for sharing! I am very much interested to hear more of your experience with the vaccine
0	I told my mom I wanna join the volunteer group but being a typical asian she gave me that deadly stare..its not the virus I'm scared of
1	little scared but will still get the vaccine for the greater good save the old ones
1	Horrifying to see all anti-vaxxers, we need to be positive to the vaccine in order to get back our normal.
1	I was hesitant about the vaccine at first but now that Dr. Seema explained it so well I will definitely be getting it
0	I‚Äôm from England üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø.. also me and so many British people will not be having the vaccine don‚Äôt trust your government!!!!!
0	They can stick their experimental vaccines in their own arms.
0	I have saved my children from  vaccinations because of a stranger at a business seminar that has informed me of his opinion about vax, 4yrs before I had my 1st kid. There are people that listen.
0	We need the Republican politicians to vaccinate the Democrat politicians and the Democrat politicians to vaccinate the Republican politicians, on camera, with an independant public forum verifying that they use real vaccines to see how well they trust these vaccines.
1	The "EBOLA" vaccine is for only one strain and clinical studies have yet to be conducted.
1	When Anti-Vaxxers refuse they vaccine they must also be made to sign a waiver that neither them or any of their family will receive treatment by the NHS when they catch COVID-19, and they are locked in quarantine until they die/recover. Simples!
1	My old folks got it a week ago, going back in a couple weeks for round 2. Huge weight off my mind.
1	Get the vaccine and a good mask to protect each other :)
0	I‚Äôm over 50, and it‚Äôs a firm No from me.
0	I don‚Äôt plan on taking it because I just never take medicine or get the flu shot.
0	I'm just worried about the long term effects
1	The problem is suspicion isn‚Äôt scientific proof. There‚Äôs a reason we don‚Äôt have smallpox anymore.
0	They will be blaming the virus for people dying from the vaccine
0	I'll take my chances and use my immune system, !!!!
0	new broadcaster again doesnt ask the question - what are the long term health implications fwetr having it ..........Not one has asked that question (always a live or die dichotomoy) lazy, and not nuanced
0	I heard over a radio call in that the vaccine has a permanent sterilization effect.  If so, would that be  permanent sterilization for this USA and worldwide.  If this is true what is the "ingredient" in the vaccine that would cause the sterilization????
0	These ppl should change there name to daily dose of vaccine
1	We'll see. as I'm at the high risk persons list, I got the 1st dose last month and will have the 2nd dose in 2 weeks. I'll let you know.
0	I've seen enough. It's a strong no for me. If you still think it's safe, please search a bit more, you clearly still have no idea..
0	I understand their refusal. This vaccine was rushed and the long term effects are unknown.
1	Can‚Äôt wait for a Covid-19 vaccine  or just a better prevention cause.
0	They will never admit it was their vaccine. They have millions of doses they want to inject into us. Besides, the underlying reason for this vaccine is not for the bogus COVID, but for population control.
1	I like how you think 3900000 deaths is absolutely nothing....Like mate come on! Even with 0.05% chance of death 3900000 people will die and HUMANITY says even a single death is a TRAGEDY. Unless your non human, You should probably go pro vaccine. Maybe better researched ones but still Pro vaccine
1	It‚Äôs never gonna stop, people poisoning other people‚Äôs minds, sickos!!!!
0	Everybody ain‚Äôt getting the same shot! They ant fooling nobody!
0	IT IS NOT A FREAKING VACCINE!!!! a vaccine protects you, this does no such thing.
0	I still scare,I only vac.ones for the flu.I don't want too.
0	In fact, there is no proof, based on gold standard double blind placebo controlled published tests, that the new covid vaccines actually are worthy of being claimed safe and effective. There is a strong likelihood that covid will mutate and render as useless any current potential vaccine effectiveness. You school, your church, and your town are run by jesuits, and if you don't understand this,  they are happy for you to stay warm, fuzzy, and happily nestled cozy in their snare.
1	Today I had my first Covid Vaccine this will enable me to protect not only Rachel, but also the NHS and all those that are unable to have the vaccine
1	GOD BLESS PFIZER AND ASTRA ZENECA!!!!!!
0	Give mine to boris johnson
0	I don't need a vaccine. I'm am not in a high risk group. I have a very small chance of catching this, and a very small chance of getting really sick if I do. Protect the old and weak and let the rest of us get on with keeping the economy alive.
0	Guess who's not taking it? ME!
1	Until they see with their own eyes it's safe then more people will be willing to vaccinate.
0	7 billion people minus one, I don‚Äôt want a stupid vaccine, I thought it‚Äôs okay to be smart- don‚Äôt smart people question everything they are told?? This vaccine is phishy af that‚Äôs all I know
1	Yes, I would get a COVID vaccine.
1	‚ÄúWe need politicians that believe in Science‚Äù  Half of Americans: Downvote
0	do NOT take the vaccine
0	The expert opinion I listen to is from Dr Michael Yeadon. He hasn't been bought.
1	The sooner everyone is vaccinated, the sooner everyone gets back to drinking and business as usual.
0	If you are pro-vaccine then you are anti-science.
0	It attacks a protein in the placenta rendering women sterile.
1	I will be getting the vaccine asap. My parents are both in several high risk categories. I have been so scared for them and want to protect them as much as possible.
0	Don‚Äôt forget to hail Satan after you get this!
1	Actually, the vaccine does help stop you from becoming seriously ill with the virus, and substantially reduces your likelihood of infecting others.
0	Man playing god again, you probably shouldn't take vaccine.
0	Let them have the vaccine. Every one who takes it can serve as the guinea pigs for those of us who have no intention of taking it.
1	Long-term effect of covid is worse! I will take the vaccine for sure.
0	no thank you ! experiment for the government!
0	I'm not getting it, but I will only hang with people that do get it!
1	You can not travel or do any work or help anyone..without vaccinations
1	You guys are doing such a great job informing us about the vaccine! Thank you! <3
0	VACINES WILL KILL EVERYONE!!!!!
0	I already know that I will never get one because I would like to die a natural death....
0	I got my MMR Vaccine yesterday. Today I woke up dead. Coincidence? I think not.
1	List your sources that proof vaccines are bad. Do it now.
0	Id rather contract covid then get vaccine !
0	The covid vaccines are "Authorized for Emergency Use" by the FDA. "Authorized for Emergency Use" is not the same thing as "Approved". Dr. Crotty uses the word "approved." The vaccine roll-out is an on-going study not yet "approved" by FDA.
0	No way, not even if they try take my job and freedom I still won‚Äôt let them put that crap in me
0	Unless I am physically restrained and literally force to be injected with this garbage then I will never take it.
0	There have been many great documentaries showing vaccine injury.  But NOTHING has ever shown vaccine-free families.
0	You cannot fool the world this days your vaccine is a scam
0	If the mRNA message disappears so quickly, how does it make enough spike protein to trigger an immune response?
0	Hey guys, I'm new here. Is it a joke or physological test made by government or people are actually stupid enough to believe this "science"?
1	I have epilepsy. How would the vaccine make my epilepsy react ??
1	I have plenty of health issues right now so I will probably wait until they resolve before taking the vaccine.
0	they've been giving vaccinations for decades, and not one has been successful to any great percentage...count me out...I'll rely on God and my natural defenses.
1	I‚Äôm getting my first vaccine today kinda scared....but just feel I have too
1	I'm not a risk patient for the flu, but I still get my flu shot because having the flu, even if I have a fairly good immunity, sucks cock and I hate it.
0	I DEFINITELY DONT WANT PFIZER'S VACCINE. I'LL WAIT A BIT ....
1	Do vaccines occasionally harm a person? Yes. Do vaccines do much more good than bad overall? Also yes.
1	Good. Hopefully it's up to 2M per day by February.
0	at greater risk for what? For catching a virus that for most people is less dangerous than the common cold? Taking the vaccine is much riskier, but if you want to take it, go right ahead!
1	It‚Äôs breaking my heart, my autistic 9 year old just wants to go play basketball with his friend down the road, and I can‚Äôt risk letting him (his mother and I have weak lungs). We need these vaccines so bad....
0	What you NEED to know is that NOBODY knows the long term effects.
0	Pfizer and madorna have immunity to being prosecuted for what they put in that vaccine. So you can't sue them if you're completely crippled after it.
1	I really think that people should stop scare postings over the Vaccines...its frightening enough the whole situation without speculating and causing more angst
1	Vaccines are unfortunately a victim of their own success. When diseases are pushed under, it becomes easy to underestimate them.
0	Numerous people have already died from this vaccine and the corrupt agencies will never admit it.
1	I'll be getting the vaccine as soon as possible so that I can make sure I'm protecting the people that I'm forced to interact with at the grocery and otherwise as well as their families.
1	I'm scheduled to be vaccinated on thursday. I work in a covid unit and see the devastation of this virus, so I'm really excited it's finally here. I've been keeping up with the science because, like anyone, I don't want to roll up my sleeve to something that isn't safe. I feel confident in this vaccine. mRNA vaccines have been studied for over a decade. The reason this one was developed quickly is because the whole world was throwing money at this project. It's amazing what can be accomplished with such a huge collective effort. Roll up those sleeves, America. Let's save a life and get back to something more normal.
1	By God I never thought I'd see the day
1	I got the first dose, I have sore arm, slight fever and chills but I know the benefits outweigh the pain. I don`t know if the scientists read this but please stop torturing those poor animals in the lab by injecting them with this painful vaccin, sticking a swab in their nose to see if they have covid! I know as a human is gonna do me good but animals don`t know, for them is torture. Aren`t we humans cruel, to save our species we inflict so much pain to others :( I just want to say a big thank you to all those poor lab animals and hopefully they didn`t die in vain and this vaccine will work and they are done with testing more trials on animals.
0	Hell yes! Since the WHO declared war on anyone who wants freedom to decide what goes into their family's bodies this has become more important than ever. Thank you for giving us a voice!
1	Who would win: Professional doctors with a PhD degree from a top university explaining the vaccine? One facebook Karen?
1	"Vaccination has greatly reduced the burden of infectious diseases. Only clean water, also considered to be a basic human right, performs better.1 Paradoxically, a vociferous antivaccine lobby thrives today in spite of the undeniable success of vaccination programmes against formerly fearsome diseases that are now rare in developed countries."
1	So the anti vax people want to die rather than being alive
1	This comment field makes me sick. I sure hope the real world has a more sober view on science‚Ä¶
0	I'm not takin no vaccine shot especially from a mf I buy lotion from
1	If we get vaccinated, the virus will disappear! All I want if my life back
0	SAFE AND EFECTIVE!! THAT'S WHY THEY WON'T REVEAL ALL D INGREDIENTS AND COMPONENTS, NOR THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE 4 THE SECUNDARY EFFECTS AND U CAN'T SUE THEM!!!
1	I can‚Äôt wait to take my dose
0	My dad's 53 got diagnosed with terminal cancer at the beginning of lock down sadly. It's a no from his aswel.
1	I was talking to a physician at a regional medical center over the weekend. At his hospital, over 95% of the physicians have chosen to get vaccinated, and just 45% of the nursing staff. I found that disheartening.
1	Of course vaccines aren't 100% safe. But here's the kicker: No medicine is!!
1	I received my moderna vaccine 1 week ago, so far so good
1	Got mine yesterday! Arm is sore but otherwise feeling great. So appreciative of all the brilliant people that made it happen!
0	Remeber the narcolepsy incident after the swine flu, I will wait a bit before taking the shot
1	Get your shots. Don't let China bio warfare spread.
1	Had it Tuesday. I felt fine until the next morning, woke up with crazy sore muscles and my vaccination arm was nearly useless. Today I feel fine, site is a bit sore. Since I treat COVID patients three days a week, totally worth it.
0	Politician and the scientist should of taken the vaccine publicly first. Using our healthcare workers as guinea pigs is just weak.
0	Never take ha
1	It‚Äôs amazing how fast this got approved versus other vaccines. We need it
0	My wife is pregnant, I don't want to let them vaccine my child, how should I proceed? Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.
0	When someone says "just because it's safe" in regards to an experimental vaccine should give us pause. Remember DDT was "safe"!
1	health care workers should be first for the needle
1	LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
1	I almost forgot about how much I loved meeting random weird groups of people while going out w/ my friends, always ending up at some random taco shop (or Denny‚Äôs) at the end. Swapping Snapchat‚Äôs and never seeing them again. I feel like I took it all for granted but those times are coming back soon enough!!
1	People are so privileged to be able to get vaccines.
1	If antivaxxers don‚Äôt take the vaccine, normal people MUST take the vaccine.
0	So you're going 2 get the vaccine right. I want you to take live on YouTube
0	We√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had adverse reactions to vaccines before so we are not going to have anymore as the risk is worse on taking it than not taking it.
0	"NEVER be first in line, for next best thing"... 107yr old- D. ROSS
1	I‚Äôm getting my second and final dose tomorrow
1	I‚Äôm not sure why you are so determined to find reasons why the vaccine does not work.  There is clear evidence that it does work.  The stuff you sent makes no point at all, because most of Israel is not yet vaccinated.
1	Pfizer will make the first covid 19 medicines
1	I received the vaccine and no problems here thankfully.
0	we are test RATS!
0	You have no clue of what the side effects will be until more people are vaccinated. You have a tiny sample to work with right now.
1	I have to say I am relieved to see how many people want the vaccine. I was worried about the anti vax population but all I‚Äôve seen so far is people begging to get it
0	Fuck the vaccine it's way to early. If you get it within the next year, you're a free test subject because of fear.
1	Just got my first dose yesterday. Honestly for side effects all I've had is some arm pain but that should be anticipated with any vaccine. I would encourage people to take it as I got it and I'm perfectly alright. As the video explained ( if you watched it ) that the vaccine makes your body produce the spike protein so if you ever do catch Coronavirus your body should fight it off. I'm going to get my second dose on 2/11/21. What I think is messed up is people fearing the one thing that could end the pandemic than the virus itself.
1	I love seeing all of you get vaccinated! But don't post your vaccination cards on social media! Posting your vaccination card on social media could lead to a scam or even identify theft.
0	The harder you work at trying to change people's minds where this vaccine is concerned the more suspicious of it they are going to become. People's feelings should be respected and we should use plants for medicine not chemicals.
1	Took the vaccine sino pharma and i'm still well and alive!!!
0	There is no long term research to back up their claims. So good luck!
0	Okay I'm not an antivaxxer or conspiracy theorist, but Johnson and Johnson? I learned not to trust their tear free shampoo, and I'm not making the same mistake again
1	So much fear around this vaccine and people firm on how they believe it works
0	NO. At least for now. I think vaccine development was rushed and not enough testing was conducted.
0	Autism was never heard of in the scientific community until they started administrating vaccines in the 30's.
1	Well if people r too stupid to vacinate , feel sorry for them and their families.
0	Solution? Forget trying to influence your legislators. Boycott all pediatricians! Simple and effective.
0	Y‚Äôall can take as much as this as y‚Äôall want. I‚Äôll be fine
1	Another reason to be mad at antivaxxers is because they can spread disease. Some people don‚Äôt have health insurance or could afford certain vaccines, meanwhile these people who do have health insurance and are privileged enough to afford it choose not to.
0	the best way to cure covid 19 is to stop watching tv
0	Sure! The COVID-19 vaccine is totally safe, until it is administered!
1	Lot's of things have happened in the last 45 days. Please do an update. EUA for the Pfizer is expected on 15 Nov. BTW, I will take it as soon as possible.
0	We don't need your vaccine
0	How they can come up with vaccines faster then the making of face mask???
1	Not sure this is the case. My work sent 22k 1a invitations, and about 8k people scheduled a vaccine. There is undoubtedly hesitation on the part of many people, even in healthcare.
0	Heeeeell no don‚Äôt take it lol
0	Well my mom started losing her hair so it must be a good thing right?
0	If you dont trust government, why would you trust this?, after all, it too is governed.
0	Stick it where the sun don't shine
0	SATANS JAB!!!!
1	Vaccine safer than getting virus.
0	Get mRNA of all the good things on this earth and inject it onto Mars. There goes our 2nd earth!
0	Should never ever be forced or pushed into taking the vaccine. I won't be taking it. Gonna leave the Matrix
1	Really appreciate your unbiased much needed ‚Äúmake-sense‚Äù analysis. Thank you. As far as I know Moderna is also developing on same mRNA technology and their result should be published in 1 or 2 weeks, let‚Äôs hope for the best.
1	Bro why even talk to anti vaxers if they want to die let them
0	When you die from their Ritual cult serum they count it as a covid death.
0	I have God, i will not put that poison in my body
0	It'll be a cold day in hell before I ever get a vaccine especially from the government
0	IM NOT an anti-vax person, but I will not be taking the vaccine for at least a year or two.
1	One should get vaccinated to protect yourself and others around you.
1	I'm 70 tomorrow (Wednesday) & get my jag on Thursday. Everyone I speak to, whether in the city or in rural Ayrshire, very impressed with the whole vaccination process.
0	this is good info, i'll pass on the vaccine. my body my choice right?
1	Definitely not going to be in the priority group, but if I ever get a chance at it, I'll take my chances. Partially because I'm keen for travel to resume, and partially because we can't be having everyone take a wait-and-see approach. Someone's got to go first.
0	I know it was the vaccine that changed my baby cousin forever no one can tell me different
0	As an Adult...thankfully I have never had to take a vaccine...Not going to start now...I trust my immune system.
1	If you're not getting it because it's "rushed" you're mistaken
1	UK is vaccinating at a per capita rate equivalent to more than 2 million per day in the US. Hope we can get there soon.
0	I don't even get the flu vaccine. Haven't had the flu in 7 years.
1	I hate to tell you this, but everyone being vaccinated will not make Americans normal.
1	I got my vaccine 2 days ago!!!
1	The vaccine reduced my age by about 10 years. Greatest thing to ever happen to me.
1	The risks of adverse effects from catching COVID are much more severe and certain.
1	Vaccines prevent you from getting a disease.
0	So proud of my fellow thinkers and the vaxxed team.
1	Finally i will take the vaccine tommorrow
1	I feel very fortunate that i received my first shot last week. Its been a hard year wondering if the next patient you interact with might have Covid. A good year of wearing an N95 for 10 hours a day, pay reductions and a 6 month partial furlough. At least once a day a patient I have dealt with is positive that either wasn't wearing a mask or was not thought to have Covid (asymptomatic). It was a significant/emotional/happy moment that I know many of my fellow co-workers experienced this week when we got that first jab.
0	we dont want this unnessary vaccine....it is not a conspiracy.
1	For the sake of the people around me i will, but im not very inclined to...
0	You guys seem so excited... tell you what, I will sacrifice my shot and give it to one of you
1	According to the CDC's 2017 report, 91.5% of children aged 19-35 months were vaccinated against MMR, 92.7% against polio. Vaccination acceptance is way more universal than the internet's portrayal of vaccination rates
1	I've never had issues/bad side effects from vaccines so I've got no reason not to. Just like I've had the flu shot every year of my working life (because working in courthouses is pretty high risk for flu).
1	Talked to my pcp, GI, and infectious disease specialist all whom said vaccine is safe with my condition and with the medications I‚Äôm on. Hope it helps!
1	All and all so unbelievably happy to be vaccinated!
1	Israeli data supports Pfizer vaccine effectiveness - 128,600 fully vaccinated, 20 positive COVID cases
1	Spring lasts until June 19 so I would certainly hope so
1	I would be the first to do it if I could!!!!!!
1	Vaccinate your kids karen
1	With all due respect, what about the older people in nursing homes and first responders?
0	I'm so sorry for the families shattered by vaccine injuries. Thank you to these families who share their heartbreaks.  You are saving so many lives!!!! Please people wake up.
1	I would get it.
1	SO EXCITED!! Getting my first shot tommorrow!!!!
1	This is great news. Of the 75,000 people who received the vaccine in a controlled study, NOT ONE PERSON has died of covid and very few have been hospitalized.
1	I got the moderna vaccine and i have pre existing medical conditions i remember i had to wait in line for 2 hours to get vaccinated. Once I got in I tried to explain to this lady about my hormonal disorder. She didn't understand, so then i said that I also have asthma and then she said well why didn't you just say that!! So then I went to another station and they told me that I would be getting the moderna vaccine. Then after I got the vaccine they had everyone wait outside for 15 minutes in case of an allergic reaction. I went home and started feeling weird I got aches and pain a over I got a headache. Next day woke up with a headache and sweating a lot. After just pain in my arm and swelling because I have a crapy immune system. If you have a good immune system you'll be fine. My mother got it the same day as me and she felt nothing
0	Roll it out quickly, before the Sheeple get wise!
0	So if the vaccine only blocks symptoms, it sounds like it is just creating more asymptomatic spreaders of the virus rather than stopping it. I don't think you can call that a vaccine...a vector maybe..
1	Not scared of getting sick myself, but scared of infecting others. I want to be able to meet family who are in the riskgroup!
0	she knows better. she ain't getting it.......No way will I put my trust in the corrupt Pharmaceutical Companies, or the CDC , who is a vaccine company . I would be safer trusting the Mafia.
1	Notice the groups of people who are never involved with anti vaxxers. Doctors, virologists, chemists, teachers, scientists
1	"I'm NoT GeTTiN iT cAuSe I'm heALthy " Yall. Kids and people with certain illness can't get this. We need to protect them.
1	You‚Äôre still glad you got all those vaccines when you were a kid, right? So get one against COVID. Please inform yourself before spreading misinformation.
1	I‚Äôm getting mine as soon as it‚Äôs available for me! My grandmother for her first phizer vaccine today and is doing very well so far.
0	I think Big Pharma is insisting on vaccines to give cover for massive nuclear contamination. Vaccines CAUSE almost the same symptoms that exposure to radioactive contamination, only often more immediately apparent (nuke exposure takes 4-7 generations to show up the worst effects).
1	And the vaccine is the only thing today that can stop the pandemic
0	After a few years, who knows what may happen!
1	Get the vaccine so we can have an awesome 2021 concert season. I miss you all.
1	I have had the first dose. Can't wait for the second. My question for the anti vaccine brigade. Why would any government want to harm, track individual people. What is their objective you give all these horror scenarios, but WHY would every government in the world be doing this. My heartfelt love goes out to all the brilliant minds that have developed this vaccine for as I believe the GOOD for mankind.
0	A coworker of mine lost a family member last week after he got the vaccine. He was 85 but she said he was in great shape for his age. The day after he got the shot he started feeling funny and his blood pressure went up to dangerous levels. He went to the ER and as the doctors were trying to bring his blood pressure down he got a brain aneurysm and died. Could have been coincidence but it's a strange situation.
1	im taking that vaccine the second it comes out
0	Thank you for  the video,  however  instead of COVID VAccine you should say/write Pfizer Vaccine because there is a big difference between Pfizer Vaccine and Oxford etc...
0	Over my dead body will I get the vaccine or trust the government
0	By CDC's own numbers recovery rates are higher than the vaccine effectiveness. ...I'll pass
1	Alrhough I don't understand everything, at least I understand something! Ty, Jesus bless you Medcram
0	WHAT ABOUT THE ONE'S DYING AT THEIR FIRST INJECTION
