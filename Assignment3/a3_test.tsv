0	#Poison
1	13k idiots. Natural selection. Let the people who wanna be safe. Don’t take it. More for the smarter people.
0	3 versions of poison
1	90% is hugely effective! They're not done with Phase 3 trials, but this is very promising. I'm overjoyed. Thank you, scientists!
1	A vaccine created in a year is an amazing achievement for science and humanity . I feel proud to live in these times.
0	A weapon of mass destruction portrayed as a cure for another weapon of mass destruction.
1	Absolutely. For me, being a college student, the benefits far outweigh the risk. I love your videos, and thank you for keeping us all informed about this new type of vaccine.
0	After almost dying from a cortisone injection which a doctor said was safe I can say that I would fight to the death before letting anyone inject my future children with any big pharma drug.
1	All COVID-19 vaccines that are in development are being carefully evaluated in clinical trials and will be authorized or approved only if they make it substantially less likely you’ll get COVID-19
1	All countries, rich and poor, are deeply affected by the virus, and that the vaccination or vaccine distribution should be for all, not for the few.
1	All who doesn’t take the vaccine want Corona to keep harvesting lives and wreak Havoc upon the world
0	All you have to do is build your immune system zinc vitamin D three vitamin C find a good holistic doctor and talk to them you don't need the vaccine
0	Already had covid not taking a vaccine
0	Alright, so now look into the covid protein spike and it's prion capable modification. Make sure you understand what you are getting yourself into when you take those shots, and it will also shed some light on the side effects you may have seen.
1	Amazing news! I just hope that people will think about the bigger picture here. Yes covid has a 99% survival rate but I encourage everyone to have this vaccine to protect the vulnerable in society not just themselves!
0	And when one dies after the vaccine, it means the patient is not funcioning.
0	Aren’t these vaccines still very experimental?
0	As a healthcare worker, I am NOT taking the vaccine at all. As an Army veteran, I do not trust it.
1	As a participant, who definitely got the vaccine, that's awesome news. Please get vaccinated with this or another approved vaccine when possible people, and trust science for goodness sakes.
1	AstraZeneca seems to be more effective and researched. It seems promising and not rushed. I'll wait on them.
0	Better develop medication to give to people who need it in case of Covid instead of poisoning healthy folks.
1	Biontech and curevac basicly startet the mrna thing and, after they cured covid, they could also find a cure for cancer with this technology. Very promising.
1	Boom! What a fantastic achievement by researchers, scientists, AI and ML professionals and field professionals! Just a colossal achievement!
1	Both natural immunity and immunity produced by a vaccine are important parts of COVID-19 disease that experts are trying to learn more about, and CDC will keep the public informed as new evidence becomes available.
0	But they have not seen the data of the side effects but they are advertising the vaccine already. Something is not right
1	COVID-19 vaccination is a safer way to help build protection
1	COVID-19 vaccination will be an important tool to help stop the pandemic
1	COVID-19 vaccination will help keep you from getting COVID-19
0	Call it a treatment. It’s not a vaccine. It doesn’t even fit the CDC definition for a vaccine.
1	Can't wait for my parents to get vaccinated.
1	Can't wait to get a vaccine... any vaccine
1	Can’t wait until my son can get it.
1	China vaccines good
0	Considering they weren't even rushing in that case as they are now I see no reason to trust whatever vaccine they come out with and I'll definitely not take their vaccine until at least 2/3 years pass without incident
0	Covid and the mask isn’t the problem. It’s the vaccine.
1	Crazy how some people believe the links their friends post on Facebook more than doctors who have studied medicine for years.
0	DON’T DO IT! Well, it is your choice but don’t tell me to do it!
1	Day 11 on Moderna and I feel fine. Just had sore arm the day after I got it.
1	Day 12 on moderna no side affects so far I feel good
0	Deadly cocktail of chemicals
0	Definitely not taking this poison
0	Don't let the government infect you're cells with RNA. You're natural immune system is all you or anyone needs! Believe in nature and yourself!
0	Don't take this poison
0	Don't take this vaccine guys!!
0	Don't trust these "vaccines".
0	Dude if they make a "vaccine" less than a year then you know somethings up.
0	Eat healthy take care of your immune systems then you won’t need vaccines love your body and yourself.
0	Ehhhh no thanks.
0	Even if u have the vaccine u dont get to go back to normal and u might die or be left with a disabily or bizarre illness so why would u have it?
1	Even if vaccines did cause autism, weird how some parents would rather have their kid dead than disabled
1	Everyone should take the vaccine Even the anti-vaccine people
0	Evil. No scientific data supporting efficacy...do your own research. Pathogenic Priming is a huge hurdle that mRNA vaccines have struggled with and is a major unknown risk...Do NOT take this vaccine.
1	Exact same side effects as every other vaccine, people are just always scared of the unknown.
0	Explain why you get a sore throat from the vaccine and all the symptoms of having the virus. That can only happen if it is invading cells!
1	Flu vaccines regularly have 40-60% efficacy, considered to be good. Anything that is 60% - 90% efficacy is 'simply the best'
1	For anyone wondering, the vaccines are perfectly safe. I got mine today and didn’t immediately die. My mom also got her’s a week before mine and she’s fine
0	Fully test them first and let all of the pharmaceutical companies do what's in the best interest of the public. Not about the profit.
1	Fully vaccinated!!! Suck it COVID!!!
1	Get your vaccines, it's better than being dead.
1	Getting my first vaccine tomorrow. This helped out my mind at ease a bit.
0	Giving people this vacchine is a crime
1	Glad they can be vaccinated. Wish availability of vaccine vastly improves so all who want a vaccine can get one.
0	God’s intelligence is far superior. Our body is a self healer with right diet and environment. Our body is our doctor. Vaccines is designed to depopulate the world. Herbs are created for us to treat our illness by that supreme being. Please try to understand that we are being controlled. It’s all business. Money making.
1	Good news because the pace of vaccination needs to pick up soon. Two million a day in the U.S. should be the floor.
1	Good news!
1	Goodness I'm so happy you made this video!! The amount of anti-maskers and anti-vaxers is increasing and its so disappointing! Spreading right info and educating the general public is more important than ever! So thank you for this!
1	Got my 2nd dose of moderna Thursday. No side effects!
1	Got my 2nd dose of vaccine no symptoms and no pain
1	Got my Pfizer vaccine 1st dose today, about 8 hours ago. Feels about the same as a flu shot. Shoulder a bit sore, a bit fatigued. I think after a good nights sleep tonight I'll be fine.
1	Got my first Moderna shot yesterday. Minor pain in the shoulder and fatigue the day after.
1	Got my first moderna vaccine today. Health department texted at 1pm went right over to the site and was done by 2 pm. No way was I not going to get this shot.
1	Great news. Fantastic work by those involved in creating this vaccine, so thankful to them.
1	Great! Normalcy can't come soon enough, but we are almost there.
0	Guess who’s not taking it??? ME!!!!
0	Hell no, I'm not getting the vaccine. The only person I know that got it died three days after their 2nd vaccination!
0	Hell no... no vaccine
1	Honestly not taking the vaccine is irresponsible because it puts others in danger. People who refuse the vaccine because it is “too new” and “dangerous” are 1) wrong because the newest vaccines are similar to old vaccines proven to work, just specific to covid strains, and 2) selfish for putting their own standards above the livelihood and health of others.
1	Hope he got the vaccine. Either way thank you to him for furthering science!
1	How do we say thank you to the health workers and scientists for their sacrifice and service? Receive the vaccine as soon as one can to lessen their load and keep wearing a mask to protect fellow citizens. In my 80th year, I am grateful and hopeful for better days ahead.
1	Huge news to get vaccine to the masses. We’re going to have a great summer America! Hope you’ve been working on that beach bod during quarantine
1	Hype ! Gonna take my Vaccine immediately . So cool . !
0	I WILL NEVER GET THIS VACCINE ! It needs more time to develope
0	I ain't got to plan for the side effects..cause I ain't gettin it!!! Suckers!!!
1	I already got my vaccine and getting my second dose in mid January. hoping 2021 is a better year for all of us.
1	I already had covid but I’m still getting the vaccine in few days, need my life back
1	I also got the vaccine, Moderna, and 5 days after I felt some inflammation in my axillary lymph nodes. Which suggests that I am forming an immunity, but just something that I wanted to share since it was pretty noticeable. I also had soreness of the injection site but other than that nothing else.
1	I also work in healthcare, I am proud to be a Caregiver and yes if I can get the vaccine I will. The well being of my Family and my clients are number one.
1	I am 80 and my wife is 77 and we took the Moderna vaccine and had no side effects on either shot.
1	I am a UCLA retiree and I still can’t even get my first vaccine because I cannot find any appointments
0	I am a double organ transplant recipient with a compromised immune system. My transplant Dr. said absolutely no! Not nearly enough tests or results available yet.
0	I am against a vaccine for Covid! It has a massive survival rate 99.777%! Eat clean and exercise I’m not taking a vaccine for Covid
1	I am fully vaccinated and was fine second dose just soreness
0	I am healthy in my 60's. Never had any shots/ vaccines since grade school. Not taking it! Never!
1	I am planning to take one of these vaccines I believe they are going to make a difference I have no intention of wanting to be locked in doors to stay safe. Bring it on
0	I believe covid-19 was created in a lab by the Chinese government. The vaccine will just make covid-19 mutate exponentially faster to than it already is. Virus always is faster and smarter than any human can possibly imagine.
0	I can't believe anyone is fine with having genes being changed
1	I can't wait to get mine. Unfortunately my special Premier and his cabinet members who were all traveling abroad for Xmas (on Dec 13th they put a traveling ban both for cross provinces and international borders) are deemed more important than me and the majority of the population, so I have to wait.
1	I cant wait to receive my vaccine.
0	I do NOT plan on taking these EXPERIMENTAL vaccinations! Even now they have to trace you for two years after taking them because the "researchers" do not know what to expect. Frontline doctors and the American Association of Physicians and Surgeons have a better plan!!!
0	I don't care about your facts or myths. Its all BS to me. I will never take this ridiculous vaccine! They will never tell you what's really in it! THINK TWICE!!
0	I don't know anyone eager to trust a new injection with no long term testing. The scientific community wavered so much on during Covid they didn't exactly inspire confidence in getting something right the first time. I understand that's how science works and that's also why I won't be getting the vaccine
0	I don't think I need to be vaccinated for a virus that has a 99% survivability rate. So, no, I won't be getting the vaccine.
0	I don't trust it still I won't be getting it
1	I don't understand why 20 percent of careworkers wont have the vaccine .How can they say they care for their clients if they potentially will bring the infection back .Some are visiting 6 or 7 homes a day .If they dont care enough to have the vaccine they should find another job
0	I don’t care what is said, I am not getting the Covid vaccine
0	I don’t fully trust the vaccine yet until a couple months pass
0	I don’t need a vaccine, the vitamin gummy bear I ate 4 years ago got my back
1	I don’t trust trump, but I do trust the vaccine. I’m getting it ASAP.
0	I don’t want a vaccine no way, why can’t they treat the common cold, something isn’t right
1	I feel like I lost brain cells watching these anti vaxxers
0	I feel so bad for all the people who are being duped into taking this
0	I feel sorry for people who get the vaccine, because they have no idea what it does to them :( the vaccine is not for covid19, the agenda is way different.
0	I find it very unsettling that the majority of the covid videos had a like to dislike ratio of 1 to 10 or so. Now, it's about the opposite. Don't trust the illusion, guys. The vaccine kills.
1	I getting my second Moderna vaccine shot tomorrow
1	I got both shots of the vaccine. Only had a sore arm for 24 hours. Feel fine.
1	I got mine Fri.Jan29. I get my 2nd one Feb. 29.
1	I got mine I'm doing fine
1	I got mine. I’m a kindergarten teacher. No side effects, no creepy stuff in it. If you are given the opportunity, take it. Try to be as brave and selfless as we are on the front lines in kindergarten.
1	I got my 2nd shot yesterday. No side effects unless you count that I get 5G on a 4G phone now and I have a hankering for human flesh.
1	I got the first dose of the Pfizer vaccination today. I managed to get it despite being 29 and otherwise in perfect health because I volunteer at my local hospital. Glad to be in the 10% with the vaccine so far.
1	I got the vaccine both doses of Moderna and I’m thriving. Stop putting false fears.
1	I got the vaccine, still alive and haven't grown a tail
1	I got vaccinated last week, Moderna. Zero side effects. Second shot in 2 weeks.
1	I got vaccinated with first dose 2 weeks ago and i feel great without side affects, i hope the second dose will be fine
0	I guarantee you..... the people who drop dead shortly After taking the Vaccines.... Would Still be Alive & Well if they did NOT take them
0	I guess rip to my family and anyone I know required to take these things for their jobs.
1	I had the Pfizer vaccination yesterday. Apart from a sore arm, absolutely no side effects after 30 hours.
0	I have a cousin and his wife, who do vaccine research, and collectively have 40 years experience in this field .They told me never to take a vaccine....I'll listen to them.
1	I have had both series of covid Vaccines, I am still alive and well, with no side effects besides my arm is sore from the shot. I'm proud to say I am vaccinated against covid and also the flu.
0	I have more chance of surviving with Covid than with the Covid vaccine....
1	I have stage 4 lung cancer, received my first round of covid-19 vaccine in December. No side effects other than some soreness in the muscle for a few days. I'll be receiving my second dose on the 26th. Just wanted to say thanks for all the informed info!
1	I hope l can get mine soon l am 67 and have health conditions been shielded for 4 weeks can’t wait till I can go out again
1	I just got my Pfizer biontec vaccine at UNC and I was thrilled to see your information on this to know about the vaccine in my body! Thank you so much!
1	I just made my appointment for my first vaccine.
1	I just want to thank them and every other scientist working on this around the world
0	I knew no vaccines has been effective anyway. I am not getting one.
1	I know more people who've been vaccinated than people who've had COVID. So happy to see the rollout gaining steam!
0	I know that manufacturers refuse to vaccinate with their own vaccines
1	I look at it as yes, there is some risk to the vaccine, since it's only been studied 3 months or so, but there is definite risk to Covid. I am high-risk so I'll chance it with the vaccine.
0	I love how the intention of this video totally flipped on him. Just made me more sure not to vac.
1	I personally would be happy to have the vaccine.
1	I pray Father God that all the vaccines will work and everyone will get their 2nd dose on time
0	I prefer to rely on my natural immune system, nourished by real food that we were designed to eat, good hygiene and a healthy lifestyle.
1	I received the vaccine yesterday! i am in healthcare. i have only had a sore arm and a slight feeling of hotness. other than that i feel great!
0	I refuse up get any vaccine that's this new
0	I reject your 666 inject!
1	I sure hope so. I WANT one.
1	I think god just made covid 19 for eliminate all anti-vaxxers
1	I think the vaccine is ok.
1	I took both vaccines from pfizer and feel perfectly well, its my 10th day following the second shot. just a one day arm pain. Now its up to you, either get rid of the virus or let it mutate into something stronger so that all this is useless and we'd need to go back to basics.
0	I trust that vaccine about as much as I trust the 2020 presidential election…
1	I was also one who worried about how quickly this vaccine was developed. In reality the scientists have used years...make that decades of research to develop it. When it comes right down to it, If we can’t trust science who can we trust? I’ll be ready to take the vaccine when my turn comes.
0	I will never get a vaccine. I take a vitamin B, C, and D everyday. Haven't been sick in 2 years.
0	I will never take a coronavirus vaccine, there’s a reason why their blowing this all out of proportion
0	I will never take dat poison!! You can have all my family’s doses!! Thank me later!!
0	I will rather take care of my COVID and treat it I don’t have COVID but it’s really stupid cause it’s like they put crack in the vaccine I’m glad I don’t take it
0	I will take my chances on a virus that has a 99.6% survival rate
0	I will trust my immune system. no jab for me.
1	I wish this kind of videos is what the media told in the news. I've never felt so hopeful about COVID until this video. Well done!
1	I wish we could send people back in time to see what it was like when huge percentages of children died from diseases before they reached age 5. It would offer some much-needed perspective.
0	I won't be taking the vaccine especially after what the flu vaccine did to me I was sick for 6 months
0	I won't be taking the vaccine especially after what the flu vaccine did to me😣 I was sick for 6 months🤔
0	I wont take this vernomous poisons never
0	I would NEVER consider myself an anti-vaxer but you gotta be out your damn mind to immediately take a vaccine that was characterized for being one of the fastest to make it through trials...
1	I would heavily advise you to get the vaccine but I can't force you to. Furthermore, you will probably lose your job if you work directly with people, so as not to put others at risk. Regardless, please reconsider and if I can help in anyway provide some comfort or information to persuade you, please let me know.
1	I would rather deal with the issues of the vaccines than have my child die from those diseases that the vaccines have proven to prevent.
1	I would say anybody is mandatory vaccination to go to work, travel, school. End of the pandemic and free shots for everybody
1	I'll happily take both vaccines if there are so many idiots who will forfeit theirs.
0	I'll hold off until all the beta testing has been completed and a true body count issued. Yeah, not expecting much in the way of the latter.
0	I'll take my chances with a 3 day cough instead of this vaccine.
0	I'll take my chances with the virus. Don't want to find out I can't have kids ones day because ya'll decided to rush this shit.
0	I'll take my chances without getting the vaccine! Thank you very much
0	I'll take my chances without the vaccine thank you.
1	I'm a nurse and I'm getting my first dose of Moderna tomorrow
1	I'm all for safety, but damn, we need those vaccines now. Wish there was a voluntary system where people who wanted to take the vaccine could.
1	I'm getting my first dose tomorrow and I feels so nice to have the end in sight I could almost cry
1	I'm hyped for this vaccine, even if I grow a third limb
1	I'm just happy this vaccine exists. The numbers regarding allergic reactions are reassuring, and catching the side effects of the vaccine looks comparatively better than catching the virus.
0	I'm just not sure I'll feel comfortable getting the first wave of a vaccine developed this quickly.
0	I'm not an anti vax but I would seriously want to stay away from this vaccine for a few years because this technology of developing vaccine is never been used before.
0	I'm not an anti-vaxxer but a vaccine developed in 6-12months is giving me doubts.
0	I'm not taking it
0	I'm not taking the vaccine. I don't trust it. I'm not sick either & i have a strong immune system. No way vaccine
0	I've been flush since I got it. I don't feel well and am always very tired. I would have not gotten if I knew this....
0	If 90% of infected have viable immunity why vaccinate them??
1	If FDA approved I'll take the vaccine ASAP!! I be Damn if I catch covid-19
1	If no one decided to take the vaccine, we wouldn't make any progress!
0	If the human body ain't broken, then don't fix it.
1	If we get enough people vaccinated in the entire population, there won't be as many people to care for infected with SARS-COV-2. Here's hoping we can get to that point sooner rather than later.
1	Im 15, whenever I can take a vaccine I will because I’m just so scared .
0	Im Scared That i will get the Side Effects T-T
1	Im from singapore . Already vaccinated and i feel strong
1	Im getting my covid vaccine
0	In Africa we don't want poison
1	Internet moms: vaccines are safe-ish Well it's better than having your child dead-ish
0	Is there a coffin included with vaccine ? What about costs my family has to pay.
0	Is this fake vaccine the solution of this fake Corona?
1	It is amazing that modern medicine is able to do this.
0	It is not that people are against vaccination but most people just feel that the vaccine will be rushed and without any knowledge of the long term consequences.
0	It takes more than 10 years for the side effects to appear and how they are releasing within one year this is just making us fool.
0	It takes years and sometimes decade's to get it right. I think this one is a dangerous one.
0	It's a no for me dog! Hard Pass!
1	It's gonna be like a fucking freight train. Once we pick up speed we're golden. Especially once Biden invokes DPA and it's all hands on deck.
0	It's not safe they are trying to mess with our DNA
0	Its gonna be a NO for me.
1	It’s almost like, and stay with me here, but it’s almost like the vaccines work!
0	I’m allergic to dying so I can’t take the vaccine
1	I’m happy about pfizer and the coronavirus vaccine
1	I’m just glad I’m educated enough to not abuse my children by preventing them from being Vaccinated.
0	I’m not anti-vaccination, but I find it highly concerning that this hasn’t even been around long and there is simply not enough time to adequately test long term effects. For me, this one is a hard pass. I need time to make an informed decision, not a rush to see who is first at my family’s expense.
0	I’m not getting this political vaccine
1	I’m so pumped for the vaccine even though I despise getting stabbed by a needle.
0	I’ve had covid. So has my husband. I’d rather have it over and over again each year than take vaccine. I’m not okay with being lab rat for virus that has high recovery rate.
1	I’ve had mine for 3 weeks now. Perfectly fine
1	I’ve received both of mine! It’s nice to know I can protect myself, my patients and my family.
1	Just finished my first shift volunteering at the local Covid-19 vaccination centre and I got vaccinated as well!
1	Just got my vaccine today, couldn't be more grateful and excited, so far so good
1	Just got vaccinated
1	Keep it going Moderna and thank you. Completely agree we have an engineering problem. We need the military to take over once these products come off the production lines and deliver the shot - no pun intended.
1	Keep making those doses. Good work.
0	LAB RAT VACCINE DEPOPULATON PROGRAMME !
0	Let the rich take the shots first
1	Let’s do this country great people, get your vaccine, wear a mask, use hand sanitizer, stay away from big crowds for now , what is so fucking hard about that , people in this country need to get it together.
1	Mail it to me.
1	Mandatory Covid-19 vaccinations are the way to go. Maximum suppression is the best approach to isolate this virus, and the only way to make it safe to reopen schools from kindergarten through college.
0	Maybe moderna can tell us about the mice that died during the SARS COV -1 mRNA trials? And maybe a follow up question to see if they studied second time covid-19 exposure post injection because im just confused that they weren't concerned about all the mice dieing upon second contact of sars cov-1 after injection.
0	Mmm for someone to say that vaccines are completely safe they are 100% liars because no medication or man made product is 100%
0	Most are not anti vaxxers though, they just don’t want to take a shot that was made in 9 months.
0	Most vaccines are safe . Myself and my children have just about every vaccine available . Covid vaccine is too new . Let the people who think it's safe get it . I'll wait and see what happens .
0	My body, my choice
1	My brother had (predicted) complications from his measles vaccine (and other vaccines) as a kid, but he had a somewhat underdeveloped immune system in his early childhood, so if he'd gotten actual measles, he would've likely died. He got a fever for a few days and was groggy for a while. Nothing else happened, except he didn't get sick from these horrible diseases. And he was somewhat of a worst-case-scenario and he's fine. Now he's 20 and healthy. Vaccinate your kids, peeps, or they may not make it as far as he did.
1	My grandparents are vaccinated now
1	My husband, my Dad, and I are getting our first vaccination tomorrow. We are happy to get it.
0	Neither safe nor effective. Enjoy your Poison.
0	No liability for the manufacturers. Why anyone would play the lottery with their life is beyond me.
0	No thank you I'll pass on it.... Forever!
0	No thank you.
0	No to forced or coerced injections.
0	No vaccine for aids, cancer, but in one year y'all have vaccine for covid
0	Nope enjoy you side effect crap
0	Nope not taking a rushed experimental vaccine
0	Nope not taking it! No matter what the “Experts” say!
0	Nope. This sounds like stuff from a sci fi movie. Telling my cells to make a protein it wasn't meant to make, to look like the virus. What could possible go wrong?
0	Norwegian officials said 23 people had died in the country a short time after receiving their first dose of the vaccine.
0	Not clear on why the aches and pains show up - analogy of no pain no gain doesn't cut it based on your own description of what it does - also what kind of nano particles are being used youvrather glossed over thst part?
1	Note what he said at the beginning and the end: we were able to get to finished vaccine because of all the research into other coronavira over more than a decade. They did not start from scratch!
1	Nothing terrifies me more than seeing the increasing amount of cavemen who are against science. I expect at least 14 replies about why I should be as well. I can't wait
1	Now we just need a vaccine for stupidity!!! Looking at you antivax people and you "covid isn't real" people :)
1	Now we need a vaccine to stop the spread of stupidity as in antivaxers and antimask types! 🤣
0	Of course it won’t hurt you immediately duh. The side effects kicks in later.
0	Of course people don’t want to inject a rushed product into their bodies. All the old vaccines are fine. They’re tried and tested but this new one might be risky
0	Of course they pressure parents & make them feel bad if you don't do it. Sick industry.
1	Of course vaccines aren't 100% safe. But here's the kicker: No medicine is!! They all have side effects, some more severe than others. It is always(!) a question whether the pros outweigh the cons.
1	Of course you should get it. What kind of nonsense question is that?
1	Of course.Most of all to be a patriot and protect all other humans.
0	Only 30 percent of Americans want to vaccine. The demand will drop soon enough
1	Only in America would people protest against getting a vaccine that would protect you and your family from a virus.
1	Out of all the people I know that got vaccinated, it was safe and quick for them
0	People are dying from the vaccines! Lord help us
0	People die because of it. The last one I know of is the doctor who got the vaccine and died 16 days later. So for me no thank you
0	People died already and other waiting tried to survive.
0	People need to research this crap. Good luck sheep
1	Please announce early as possible that vaccine is free far all please.
0	Please save us from people who claim to care about our health at the same time medically rape us thru injection filling us with POISON
0	Poison. That’s all to it folks!
0	Poor people think that vaccines gonna save their lives x
1	Rather than attempting to shame those who've been offered the vaccine, support and encourage them. After all, as more people get vaccinated, the better it will be for everyone--including you.
1	Received my 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Friday and besides a little injection site pain I’ve felt no symptoms.
0	Refusing the vax.
1	Sadly, there's no vaccine against stupidity.
0	Say NO NO NO to getting the vaccine.
0	Scientific evidences? Who provides scientific evidences? The same that sell you the vaccine :-) Hahahaha
1	Since I treat COVID patients three days a week, totally worth it.
0	Sir I'm so much scarred to take vaccine
1	So happy to have had my first covid vaccine
1	So sad to see the people saying no to the vaccine when they barely have an understanding of medicine.
0	So you Knowillingly are injecting the public with toxic poison then?
0	Some employers are making it mandatory to get it or be fired. I would have to be fired, cause I'm not getting it.
0	Stay away from me with that crap!
0	Stick yourselves we are out. THE PEOPLE
0	Still not touching it with a barge pole - sorry! Have done too much research of my own. See the research of Celeste Solum and Deborah Tavares of Stop the Crime.Net for the truth.
1	Sure hope there is a great cure fer it an hopefully there isnt anymore coming . it is a real bad thing . Stay home everyone if you can please.
0	THEY AIN'T SAFE AND HAVEN'T FINISHED TESTS
0	Take the vaccine then the real health problems begin. These sheep never learn.
0	Take your shot and deal with it's side effects, why are so many willing to take it when they don't know anything about it? and if you die or have side effects they aren't liable...You forgot to mention the chip to verify you have gotten it.
0	Taking Bill Gates vaccine lmao
1	Taking the vaccine will safe people
0	Tell that to the people who have died from the vaccine.
1	Thank you Moderna!!
1	Thank you for destroying antivaxxers and covidiots with logic and scientifical evidences. To be honest, I feel so impressed on how scientists and experts can develop vaccine for COVID-19 faster than ever, thanks to medical science and technology that advanced farther.
1	Thank you for making this video to clear up the misconceptions people may have! Im from Texas, USA, and a lot of healthcare workers have been administered their first dose (yay)!!!
1	Thank you scientists for working hard!
1	Thank you... I feel encouraged to now get the vaccine... I appreciate the explanation ...
1	Thanks I really needed this because I haven’t been able to see my grand parents so I finally will
1	Thanks for creating this video! There is so much misinformation being spread about the disease and the vaccine, and you have made it very simple for people to understand. I hope this helps to dispel some of the fear people have of this vaccine.
1	Thanks so much, for the info on vaccines.
1	Thanks to both of you for the great information. Where can I find more information about getting vaccinated in my state? Az
0	That's a no from me dawg.
0	The bigiest lie in history
0	The covid 19 vaccines are killing and maming people this is a fact! How about telling people they may expect death or disability after their vaccine
1	The fastest way out of this pandemic is through mass vaccination. This INCLUDES children. We can't vaccinate children without safety data - & to do that we need children in trials. If you have an adolescent interested - here's info about Moderna's trial.
1	The hospital I work for just went a full week with no new COVID cases among staff for the first time since Feb 2020. Very cool to see the vaccine in action.
1	The infection rate is 30k ish a day. Our vaccination is 20x better. Eat that COVID!
0	The next morning, Ching’s pharmacy was bombarded with calls from people anxious to be vaccinated. He had no shots left.
0	The only thing worrying me is that gates funds 5g AND vaccines. Do the two work together. Is it a frequency thing. Phone + 5g + vaccines.
0	The problem with this vaccine is that it sounds really shady and I don't like stuff that is shady.
0	The real virus is in those vaccines
1	The science behind these new vaccines is so incredibly cool. What a time to be alive!
0	The vaccine kills people.
0	The virus is fake. The hospitals are empty. The doctors' surgeries are empty. The test centres are empty. The scamdemic is a fraud. Resist fascism!
1	The worst part is the anti-vaxxers.
0	There is a multilevel agenda and much of this content endorses it. Keep that 💩 far tf away from me and my healthy family!
0	There is no money/profit in Health, only in sickness!
0	These are not vaccines in a traditional sense. They are playing with your genes.
0	They are safe for no one
1	They need to focus on vaccinate everyone above 55 like ASAP. Even in third world countries bc that thing keeps goin around around and who knows wth is gonna turn into. And old ppl are the most at risk, once theyre vaccinated they can give it to younger ppl and get that virus under control.
0	They need to shut up and know the covid vaccine is unhealthy and had not been tested that well.
0	This demon can’t even keep viruses out of windows, now he wants to vaccinate the whole world. oh my god, somebody wake up!!!
1	This is by far the best news since the vaccine came out imo. Even if the vaccine just partially stops the spread, it's still great news
1	This is good news! I can see this is the beginning of the end of this pandemic. Hopefully, this virus will be completely eradicated by next year including the new variant.
1	This is objectively very fucking good.
1	Took mine no side effects at all just arm was a little sore
1	Took my first part of the vaccine, didn't feel a thing...
0	Trials? Are you kidding? Real trials go on for years. I understand we can't do that right now. But who knows what it's going to show long-term
0	Ummm, I'll pass on that. I'll wait until these politicians and celebrities shows how effective it is. It seems like the side effects is worst than Covid-19 itself
0	Until they know the long term effects, I’ll steer clear.
1	Vaccinate the working population first and the teachers get the kids back to school and the people back to work it makes more sense before we all die from starvation
1	Vaccination is a human right .
0	Vaccine and illuminate sign this vaccine is number 666 sign that if you have no this vaccine 666 you can't buy a sell Satan program. Don't agree this .
0	Vaccine injuries have numbered in the millions.
0	Vaccine is not an appropriate word. The word is experimental. Please do your research before deciding to have an EXPERIMENTAL AGENT injected into your body. Stay safe.
1	Vaccines and medications aren’t destroying humanity, no — it’s the anti-vaxxer community’s complete ignorance and misinformation that’s destroying humanity from being able to save itself.
1	Vaccines are really good for you.
1	Vaccines are safe
1	Vaccines can't fight COVID-19 when people are unwilling to take them.
0	Vaccines have never been Double Blind Placebo tested. WHY? The only pharmaceutical used on mass where this is the case. WHY?
1	Vaccines save lives! Please don't hesitate to be a part of this universal fight against #COVID19
0	Vacination is a genocide.
1	Very grateful to have gotten the first of two doses. A) I hope they don’t give away my second dose and B) my arm hurts so bad! Soooo bac
1	Very well said as the proper treatment will save the lives of millions of people.
0	Vitamin D. Zinc. Vitamin C and others are the way for me.
1	WELL THANK GOD FOR THIS VACCINE
0	WORD OF THE LORD: DO NOT TAKE THE VACCINE. PEOPLE WILL LITERALLY BECOME ZOMBIES WITHIN THE NEXT 5 YEARS!!! Pray and confirm before you mock and scoff!
1	Watching this after getting my first dose of Moderna Vaccine!
0	We are good here in Africa, don't bring your immune destroyer here. What happened to the American senator that took the vaccine yet test positive to covid19 ?
0	We lost any trust in rich people and governments.
0	What could possibly go wrong? Never made a coronavirus vaccine before, never used mRNA before, but we're gonna do it now, as fast as possible? Yikes.
1	Why are people anti-vaxxers? I don’t get it
0	Why are the companies protected from legal action from damages caused by the vaccine
0	Why do you have to explain this over and over is it even worth it? Here in Zimbabwe we are using natural remedies and have proven effective so far so good
0	Why do you say it's safe when you don't even know what's in it.
0	Why get the vaccine if you can still get COVID if you get it??
0	Why should you vaccinate something that already works well? If your car is doing well, you don't take it to the garage, do you?
0	Why would someone get a vaccine if 10 percent gets the virus. Hummm
1	Would have loved it more if it had dedicated more explaining about the mRNA part, cause that’s the part antivaxxers use to spread fear.
1	YES GET THE VACCINE IF YOU DONT GET THE VACCINE YOU SHOULD NOT be allowed to travel international...happy now..
0	Ya know anybody who gets this thing is just straight up brainwashed
1	Yeaaaa had my vaccine today, halfway to freedom I hope, side effects with everything, its a chance you take.
0	Yeah it’s dangerous for us to think outside public opinion... that means we’re probably doing something right
0	Yeah passing on all of it.
1	Yes! Everyone associated with healthcare needs to be vaccinated. Thank you.
1	Yes, absolutely. I will get it when it is available to me given my spot on the priority list.
1	Yes, please let the public know that our scientists and medical professionals are working hard for the good of the people! ALL PEOPLE!!
0	You can have my dose.....keep that experimental biological agent. If I wanted to participate in a clinical trial, it would be for something legitimate....
1	You guys are ok to be a little scared, it's a new kind of vaccine but it should be fine.
1	You know right now we really need a covid vaccine right now
1	You should make vaccines As early as you can
0	You take it and all your friends and family. I'll see what happens at least 5 years down the track. 30 years research on these types of vaccines, no success, in less than a year, success, bingo, suspicious????????????????????
0	count me in too. im now an antivaxxer.
1	funny thing is... you are probably only still alive now because of the vaccines you and others have already taken
0	hahaha the guy who at the beginning of the video admits to sponsoring the video with some kind of application decided to get credibility for the dubious poison injection of a billion-dollar business
1	i already got my first shot 2 days ago trust me its better than having covid
0	i would take it but within 4-5 years until i know the side effecfs
1	l salute those who work hard and bring this vaccine, it will make a difference to those who is ineed and l like it.
1	mRNA actually has been used alot, just not for vaccines, it was most commonly used to fight cancer cells.
1	mRNA vaccines are such a genius method, I love it
1	must supply these VACCINATIONS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,no more deaths
0	my friend took the vaccine she’s seriously messed up now i took a video of her on my channel ,messed up stuff man
1	my parents are scared of the vaccine since " it changes our DNA" and i can give us " auntoinmune reactions and gullian barre"... how do i explain to them is not like that
0	never vaccinate your children
0	no thanks. you couldnt pay me to take the vaccine.
0	nobody should take this vaccine, after whtat 2020 has showed us if you still trust the government, you are doomed as an individual i think
0	shutting down the whole world for a year or more because of the virus, making people aware of danger to avoid in any way possible catching it, and now urging and encouraging them to put it in the body? where's the logic?
0	sounds like they're just wasting our money on a vaccine that nobody wants
0	take your vaccine and SHOVE IT!
0	the vaccines don’t even work
1	uh, YES?! YES! PERIOD! END OF DISCUSSION!
0	we don't care. we don't want it.
0	y'all take it then, i'll pass
0	you don't know the long term effects because there's not enough data? the reason why i'm not taking the shot
1	“This bridge is only 99% safe so we should just swim in the shark infested water”
1	”i’d do anything to keep my child safe” except for getting them vaccinated and preventing from getting easily preventable diseases
